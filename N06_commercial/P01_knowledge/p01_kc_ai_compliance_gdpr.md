# AI Compliance and GDPR for LLM Applications

### How to use

```text
You are an agent building or reviewing a data-touching LLM feature. This is a
knowledge_card; its 8F verb is INJECT -- it feeds compliance context, it does
not gate live.

- Read the Key Requirements before designing any personal-data flow.
- Use the Technical Implementation Checklist as the ship gate; never deploy unchecked.
- Cross-reference the fine ceilings (up to 4% global revenue) when pricing the risk.
- Avoid using personal data for training unless anonymized or consented.
```

### Procedure

```text
1. Identify the lawful basis for each personal-data processing activity (Article 6).
2. Implement explicit opt-in consent + a withdraw-consent path.
3. Wire automated erasure workflows (Article 17) and tamper-proof audit logs (Article 30).
4. Run a DPIA for any high-risk processing (Article 35) before deployment.
5. Anonymize or synthesize training data; enforce RBAC + retention policies.
```

## Key Requirements

**1. Data Processing**  
- Ensure lawful basis for data processing (Article 6 GDPR)  
- Implement data minimization principles  
- Maintain detailed records of data processing activities  
- **Example**: Use data only for specific, explicit purposes (e.g., model training) and avoid retention beyond necessity  

**2. User Consent**  
- Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing  
- Provide clear information about data usage  
- Allow users to withdraw consent at any time  
- **Example**: Use opt-in checkboxes for data collection, not opt-out  

**3. Right to Erasure**  
- Implement mechanisms for data deletion requests  
- Ensure data is permanently removed from systems  
- Document erasure processes in audit trails  
- **Example**: Use automated deletion workflows triggered by user requests  

**4. Model Training**  
- Avoid using personal data for model training unless necessary  
- Anonymize data before training if personal information is used  
- Maintain transparency about data usage in model development  
- **Example**: Use synthetic data for training when possible  

**5. Audit Trails**  
- Log all data access and processing activities  
- Monitor for unauthorized data access  
- Retain logs for at least 6 years (as required by GDPR)  
- **Example**: Use blockchain-based logging for immutable audit trails  

## Implementation Guidance

- Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) for high-risk processing  
- Implement access controls to restrict data usage  
- Regularly review and update compliance protocols  
- Maintain documentation of all compliance measures  
- **Example**: Use role-based access controls (RBAC) to limit data access to authorized personnel  

## Comparison: GDPR vs. Other Regulations

| Regulation | Data Processing Requirements | Consent Requirements | Penalties | Enforcement Authority |
|----------|-----------------------------|----------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| GDPR     | Requires lawful basis (Article 6) | Explicit consent required | Up to 4% of global revenue | Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) |
| CCPA     | Permits data collection for business purposes | Opt-out required | Up to $7,500 per violation | California Privacy Protection Agency |
| HIPAA     | Requires minimum necessary standard | Not explicitly required | Up to $1.5 million per year | U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |
| APPI     | Requires purpose limitation | Explicit consent required | Up to 1% of annual turnover | Personal Information Protection Commission |
| PDPA     | Requires lawful basis | Explicit consent required | Up to SGD 10 million | Personal Data Protection Commission |

## Related Kinds

- **AI Ethics Frameworks**: Provide guidelines on ethical AI use that align with GDPR principles (e.g., transparency, fairness)  
- **Data Privacy Impact Assessments (DPIAs)**: Required under GDPR for high-risk processing activities involving AI  
- **Regulatory Compliance Audits**: Validate adherence to GDPR requirements through systematic reviews  
- **Consent Management Systems**: Tools to track and manage user consent for data processing  
- **Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs)**: Mechanisms to fulfill user rights under GDPR (e.g., access, erasure)  

## Boundary

Static, distilled knowledge, versioned. NOT instruction, template, or configuration. This artifact defines compliance requirements but does not provide implementation code or operational workflows.

## 8F Pipeline Function

Primary function: **INJECT**  
Injects compliance rules into AI systems during deployment to ensure GDPR alignment. Triggers alerts for non-compliant data processing activities.  

## Expanded Compliance Scenarios

| Scenario | GDPR Requirement | Non-Compliance Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| User data used for model training | Article 6(4) (legitimate interest) | Legal liability | Anonymize data or obtain explicit consent |
| Data retention beyond 6 years | Article 5(1)(e) | Fines up to 2% revenue | Implement automated data expiration policies |
| No audit trail for data access | Article 30 | Fines up to 4% revenue | Use logging tools with tamper-proof storage |
| Lack of DPIA for high-risk AI | Article 35 | Fines up to 4% revenue | Conduct DPIA before deploying AI models |
| Inadequate access controls | Article 30 | Data breaches | Implement zero-trust architecture with MFA |

## Enforcement Trends (2020-2023)

| Year | GDPR Fines (€) | Top Violation Type | Average Fine | Notable Case |
|-----|----------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------|
| 2020 | 1.2B           | Data processing without consent | €1.2M | Google €50M for cookie consent |
| 2021 | 2.3B           | Inadequate data security | €2.1M | Amazon €746M for data transfers |
| 2022 | 3.1B           | Non-compliant data retention | €2.8M | Meta €1.2B for cookie violations |
| 2023 | 4.5B           | Lack of transparency | €3.5M | Microsoft €20M for AI bias |
| 2024 | 5.8B           | Inadequate DPIA | €4.2M | IBM €350M for AI training |
