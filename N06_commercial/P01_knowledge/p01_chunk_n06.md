# Commercial Chunk Strategy

## Purpose

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Goal | Split commercial knowledge into retrieval units that preserve buying context, pricing logic, and conversion leverage |
| Business Lens | Strategic Greed values chunks by revenue yield, not by document symmetry |
| Primary Use | retrieval for pricing pages, offer design, checkout friction diagnosis, renewal rescue, and upsell prompts |
| Failure Prevented | high-value evidence buried inside oversized docs or diluted inside generic marketing chunks |
| Default Method | recursive_segment_priority |
| Retrieval Bias | premium offers, objections, margin rules, and segment-specific proof stay intact |

## Method

| Setting | Value | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| method | `recursive_segment_priority` | respects doc structure while forcing monetization boundaries |
| chunk_size | `540` tokens | enough room for one offer block plus proof and objection |
| chunk_overlap | `90` tokens | keeps CTA, pricing anchor, and proof transitions connected |
| separators | `["## ","### ","\\n\\n","\\n","; ",". "]` | commercial docs usually turn on headers, paragraph breaks, and list punctuation |
| min_chunk_size | `180` tokens | rejects thin fragments that cannot support a business decision |
| max_tables_per_chunk | `1` | pricing tables become noisy when merged with unrelated copy |
| hard_boundary_labels | `pricing`, `offer`, `segment`, `objection`, `renewal`, `upsell` | protects revenue-critical sections from accidental merge |

## Revenue Priority Rules

| Rule ID | Chunk Trigger | Action | Why N06 Wants It |
|---------|---------------|--------|------------------|
| CS01 | premium tier table detected | isolate as standalone chunk | premium anchors should retrieve cleanly |
| CS02 | objection plus counter-objection pair | keep in same chunk | sales resistance only matters with the answer attached |
| CS03 | renewal risk playbook section | preserve surrounding thresholds and scripts | retention logic fails when timing rules split away |
| CS04 | free-tier limits described | bind limits with upgrade CTA | prevents retrieval of generosity without monetization path |
| CS05 | case study contains revenue metrics | keep proof with segment label | proof converts best when segment match survives retrieval |
| CS06 | bundle description spans many bullets | compress into one bounded chunk if same offer | fragmented bundles lower recommendation confidence |

## Source-Type Handling

| Source Type | Strategy | Boundary Rule | Commercial Intent |
|-------------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| pricing frameworks | recursive by header | one pricing model per chunk | keeps monetization logic atomic |
| funnel teardown | stage-based chunking | each funnel stage gets its own unit | diagnose leakage precisely |
| offer docs | offer-block chunking | one offer per chunk unless nested upsell | preserve conversion package integrity |
| battlecards | objection-led chunking | one objection cluster per chunk | fast rebuttal retrieval for sales prompts |
| retention playbooks | trigger-led chunking | one save motion per chunk | save tactics should be callable by risk state |
| competitor notes | plan-anchor chunking | one competitor plus one pricing axis | enables clean side-by-side retrieval |

## Metadata to Attach

| Metadata Key | Example | Why It Matters |
|--------------|---------|----------------|
| revenue_stage | `acquire`, `convert`, `expand`, `retain` | supports stage-aware retrieval |
| segment_value | `starter`, `growth`, `scale`, `enterprise` | high-LTV routes can ask for premium evidence first |
| offer_type | `trial`, `core_plan`, `annual`, `bundle`, `enterprise` | offer-specific retrieval lowers prompt waste |
| margin_sensitivity | `high`, `medium`, `low` | margin protection can outrank raw conversion |
| intent_signal | `cold`, `warm`, `active_checkout`, `renewal_risk` | retrieval should follow proximity to cash |
| proof_present | `true`, `false` | proof-rich chunks rerank better for persuasion tasks |

## Assembly Logic

| Step | Action | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | detect commercial document type | source profile |
| 2 | map headers to revenue stages | stage-tagged sections |
| 3 | split recursively using hard boundaries first | candidate chunks |
| 4 | merge only adjacent chunks with same stage and segment | revenue-coherent units |
| 5 | attach metadata and rank class | index-ready chunks |
| 6 | reject thin or mixed-intent chunks | higher signal corpus |

## Rationale

| Design Choice | Why It Exists | Strategic Greed Impact |
|---------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Larger-than-default chunk size | commercial persuasion needs claim plus proof plus CTA | higher retrieval usefulness per hit |
| Strong overlap | pricing anchors often reference adjacent objections | avoids losing conversion logic at boundaries |
| Hard boundary labels | revenue sections are more valuable than generic prose | keeps premium context pure |
| Metadata per chunk | retrieval quality depends on buying stage, not only semantics | routes cash-near questions to cash-near evidence |
| Thin chunk rejection | small fragments sound clever but convert poorly | protects generation quality |

## Example

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| A pricing doc contains Free, Pro, and Enterprise sections with proof blocks and upgrade CTAs | each plan becomes a separate chunk set with linked proof and intent metadata |

```yaml
name: commercial_recursive_segment_priority
method: recursive_segment_priority
chunk_size: 540
chunk_overlap: 90
separators:
  - "## "
  - "### "
  - "\n\n"
  - "\n"
metadata_keys:
  - revenue_stage
  - segment_value
  - offer_type
  - margin_sensitivity
```

## Governance

| Check | Pass Condition |
|-------|----------------|
| boundary purity | chunk contains one dominant revenue stage |
| plan integrity | no tier table split across chunks |
| proof linkage | claim and commercial proof remain together |
| ascii safety | identifiers and config keys remain unaccented |
| density | every chunk can answer a revenue question without outside rescue |
