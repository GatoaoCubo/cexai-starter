# ICP Frameworks + Buyer Persona — Universal Methods

## 1. ICP vs Buyer Persona vs User Persona

Three distinct tools often confused. Each answers a different question.

| Concept | Question | Granularity | Primary Use |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **ICP** (Ideal Customer Profile) | *Who is the best-fit customer?* | Company/segment level | Targeting, qualification |
| **Buyer Persona** | *Who makes the purchase decision?* | Individual human level | Marketing, sales messaging |
| **User Persona** | *Who uses the product day-to-day?* | Individual human level | Product design, UX |

### Key Distinctions

**ICP** = a description of the *type of company or customer segment* that gets the most value from your product and is most likely to become a long-term customer. Used to qualify leads, focus sales efforts, and guide marketing channels.

**Buyer Persona** = a semi-fictional character representing the human who evaluates, decides, and purchases. Includes demographics, motivations, objections, and information-seeking behavior.

**User Persona** = the human who interacts with the product daily. May differ entirely from the buyer (e.g., IT manager buys software; developers use it).

> In B2B: you often need all three — ICP (company), Buyer Persona (decision-maker), User Persona (end user).
> In B2C: ICP and Buyer Persona typically merge into one profile.

## 2. Strategyzer Value Proposition Canvas — Customer Profile

The customer profile has three components. Fill these out *before* designing your offering.

### Customer Jobs
What is the customer trying to accomplish? Jobs come in three types:

| Job Type | Definition | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Functional** | A practical task to complete | "Manage my team's projects" |
| **Social** | How they want to be seen by others | "Be seen as an innovative leader" |
| **Emotional** | How they want to feel | "Feel in control and confident" |

> Rank jobs by importance. Focus on the top 3.

### Pains
Negative experiences, obstacles, and risks before, during, or after getting the job done:
- **Undesired outcomes**: Things that go wrong (time loss, extra cost, poor quality)
- **Obstacles**: Things that prevent them from starting or progressing
- **Risks**: Potential negative consequences they fear

> Rate each pain: Extreme → Moderate → Slight

### Gains
Outcomes and benefits the customer wants:
- **Required**: Minimum expectations (product must work)
- **Expected**: Standard expectations (good UX, reasonable price)
- **Desired**: Beyond expectations (faster, simpler, more integrated)
- **Unexpected**: Surprises that delight (they didn't know they wanted this)

> Rate each gain: Essential → Nice-to-have → Irrelevant

---

## 3. Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Framework

Developed by Clayton Christensen, refined by Bob Moesta and Alan Klement. Focuses on *why* people make purchasing decisions, not who they are.

### Core Insight
"People don't buy products — they hire them to get a job done."

Demographics cannot explain behavior. The same person (35-year-old male, college educated) may hire a milkshake in the morning (as a meal replacement) and in the afternoon (as a treat). The jobs are different; the person is the same.

### Three Dimensions of Jobs

| Dimension | Definition | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Functional** | The practical task | "I need to get from A to B quickly" |
| **Emotional** | How they want to feel | "I want to feel safe and in control" |
| **Social** | How they want to be perceived | "I want others to see me as successful" |

### JTBD Statement Format
```
When [SITUATION/CONTEXT],
I want to [MOTIVATION/JOB],
So I can [DESIRED OUTCOME].
```

### Why JTBD Beats Traditional Personas
- Personas use demographics that don't explain causality
- JTBD explains the *pressing circumstance* that triggers purchase
- Two people with identical demographics may have completely different jobs
- Two people with completely different demographics may have identical jobs

### Applying JTBD to ICP Research
1. Interview customers who switched **to** you (why did they hire you?)
2. Interview customers who switched **away** (what job weren't you doing?)
3. Identify the "struggling moment" that triggered the switch
4. Find patterns across jobs, not across demographics

---

## 4. Job Stories (Intercom Format)

A practical evolution of JTBD for product and marketing teams. Developed by Alan Klement at Intercom.

### Format
```
When [SITUATION that triggers the need],
I want to [MOTIVATION driving the action],
So I can [EXPECTED OUTCOME / result].
```

### Why Job Stories Over User Stories

User Stories ("As a [persona], I can [action] so that [benefit]") fail because:
1. They rely on fictional demographics, not causality
2. They couple implementation with motivation
3. They ignore context, anxieties, and emotional state

Job Stories solve this by:
- Grounding in real situational context
- Separating the *why* from the *what*
- Making it possible to test assumptions independently

### Example
**User Story (weak)**: "As a project manager, I can view team status so that I know project health."

**Job Story (strong)**: "When my team is approaching a deadline and I'm in back-to-back meetings, I want to see real-time progress at a glance, so I can intervene immediately if something is about to fall through."

> The Job Story reveals: the anxiety (falling behind), the context (time pressure + unavailability), and the real job (rapid triage), not just a feature request.

## 5. Transformation Promise

Pattern used in high-converting positioning and messaging. Inspired by StoryBrand (Donald Miller) and direct-response copywriting.

### Template
```
From [BEFORE STATE — current painful situation]
To [AFTER STATE — desired future state]
Through [BRIDGE — your product/method as the mechanism]
```

### Examples

**B2C Fitness App**
```
From: Stuck in a cycle of inconsistent workouts and no visible results
To: A sustainable routine that fits your schedule and shows real change in 8 weeks
Through: AI-personalized training plans that adapt as you progress
```

**B2B SaaS (CRM)**
```
From: Sales teams wasting 30% of their time on manual data entry and guessing which leads to prioritize
To: A pipeline that self-updates and automatically surfaces the highest-intent leads
Through: AI that learns from your top performers and replicates their behavior across the team
```

### How to Use
- Use as the hero message on landing pages
- Use as the opening of sales pitches
- Use as the subject line / opener of email sequences
- Use to train copywriters and LLMs generating brand content

## 6. Three-Dimensional Segmentation

### Demographic Segmentation (Who they are)

| Variable | B2C Examples | B2B Examples |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Age | 25-34 millennials | Company age: 2-10 years |
| Gender | Female-identifying | N/A (use role instead) |
| Location | Urban Brazil, tier 1 cities | HQ location, market served |
| Income | R$5K-15K/month household | Annual revenue: R$1M-10M |
| Education | Higher education, postgraduate | Team size: 10-100 |
| Life stage | New parents, recent grads | Stage: seed, Series A, SMB |

### Psychographic Segmentation (Who they are inside)

| Variable | Definition | Research Method |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Values** | Core principles guiding decisions | Laddering interviews |
| **Fears** | What keeps them up at night | JTBD switch interviews |
| **Aspirations** | The person they want to become | Future-state interviews |
| **Lifestyle** | Daily routines, social identity | Ethnographic observation |
| **Beliefs** | Worldview, assumptions about the category | Survey + interview |
| **Self-concept** | How they see themselves vs ideal self | Projective techniques |

> Psychographics predict purchase behavior better than demographics in most categories.

### Behavioral Segmentation (What they do)

| Variable | Definition |
|----------|-----------|
| **Purchase triggers** | What event or situation causes them to seek a solution? |
| **Channels** | Where do they discover, research, and buy? |
| **Frequency** | How often do they buy/use in this category? |
| **Usage intensity** | Power user vs casual vs dormant |
| **Loyalty** | Brand-loyal vs switcher vs deal-seeker |
| **Decision process** | Impulse vs research-heavy vs committee |
| **Adoption curve** | Innovator / Early Adopter / Majority / Laggard |

## 10. ICP Validation Methods

Assumptions are not ICPs. Validate before scaling.

| Method | What it Tests | When to Use |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Customer interviews** (5-10) | Psychographics, pains, JTBD | Early stage, before building |
| **Win/loss analysis** | Which ICPs convert and churn | Ongoing, every quarter |
| **Cohort analysis** | Which segments have highest LTV | After 100+ customers |
| **Survey (n=50+)** | Demographic/behavioral patterns | Quantitative validation |
| **NPS by segment** | Which segments are happiest | Existing customers |
| **Sales cycle data** | Which ICPs close fastest, cheapest | CRM data analysis |
| **Churn analysis** | Which ICPs leave and why | After product-market fit |

### ICP Scoring Model (B2B)
Score each lead/customer 1-3 on each dimension:

| Dimension | 1 (Poor fit) | 2 (Moderate) | 3 (Strong fit) |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Industry | Outside target | Adjacent | Exactly target |
| Company size | Outside range | Edge of range | Squarely in range |
| Tech stack | Incompatible | Partial match | Full match |
| Pain severity | Nice-to-have | Important | Urgent |
| Budget | Below threshold | Possible stretch | Clearly available |
| Decision authority | End user only | Champion present | Economic buyer engaged |

**Score >= 14** = Priority ICP. **Score 10-13** = Develop. **Score < 10** = Disqualify.

## 11. Universal ICP Fill-in-the-blank Template

Works for any industry, B2B or B2C.

```
## ICP: [SEGMENT NAME]

Our ideal customer is a [ROLE/DEMOGRAPHIC] who [LIFE CONTEXT].

They are trying to [PRIMARY JOB/GOAL] but struggling with [PRIMARY PAIN].

They currently solve this by [CURRENT WORKAROUND], which frustrates them because [WHY IT FAILS].

They will know they succeeded when [SUCCESS METRIC].

They discover products like ours through [CHANNELS].

They decide to buy when [TRIGGER EVENT] and hesitate because [PRIMARY OBJECTION].

They are NOT: [ANTI-ICP — who you are explicitly not for].
```

### Example
```
## ICP: Solo Founder (B2B SaaS)

Our ideal customer is a technical solo founder with 1-3 employees who is building their first SaaS product.

They are trying to acquire their first 100 paying customers but struggling with not knowing which marketing channels to invest in.

They currently solve this by reading blog posts and testing random tactics, which frustrates them because there's no coherent system and results are inconsistent.

They will know they succeeded when they have a repeatable acquisition channel generating 10+ trials/week.

They discover products like ours through Twitter/X, IndieHackers, and founder Slack communities.

They decide to buy when they hit a plateau in growth (< 5% MoM) and hesitate because of price sensitivity and "can I do this myself?"

They are NOT: enterprise marketers, agencies, or non-technical founders with large teams.
