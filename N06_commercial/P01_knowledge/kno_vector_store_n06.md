# Commercial Vector Store

## How to use

You are an agent provisioning storage for N06's commercial corpus. This is a `vector_store`; its 8F verb is **INJECT** -- it feeds the storage/query contract into retrieval.

- Use the `Backend Contract` as canonical; pin dimensions to match the embedder (1024).
- Lean on metadata filtering for stage/segment scoping; never scan the whole collection.
- Keep the FAISS mirror for offline testing only; production reads go through pgvector.
- Enforce reindex discipline whenever chunk strategy or model dims change.

## Inputs (act-time slots)

The consuming retriever binds these from the corpus + infra context (open boundary):

```yaml
slots:
  backend: "pgvector | faiss-mirror"
  dimensions: 1024
  connection_profile: "shared_postgres_commercial"
  metadata_filters: "stage | segment | offer | objection"
```

## Procedure

1. Provision the pgvector collection on the shared commercial Postgres profile.
2. Pin the dimension (1024) to match the embedder_provider contract.
3. Index the metadata fields needed for commercial filtering (stage/segment/offer).
4. Load vectors with bounded metadata; exclude operational noise.
5. On chunk/model drift, run a full reindex to preserve similarity consistency.

## Purpose

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Goal | Persist and query commercial embeddings with strong metadata filtering and predictable operational cost |
| Business Lens | Strategic Greed prefers infrastructure that compounds into repeatable monetization over flashy infra sprawl |
| Primary Use | storage for offer, pricing, segment, proof, objection, and retention vectors |
| Failure Prevented | vector stores that are cheap to start but weak on filtering, governance, or reindex discipline |
| Backend Choice | `pgvector` on Postgres |
| Secondary Mode | local FAISS mirror for offline testing only |

## Backend Contract

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| backend | `pgvector` | metadata filters and transactional discipline matter for commercial ops |
| connection_profile | `shared_postgres_commercial` | keeps N06 close to existing app infra |
| collection | `n06_commercial_knowledge` | explicit namespace avoids cross-domain contamination |
| dimensions | `1024` | aligned to commercial embedder profile |
| distance_metric | `cosine` | stable for normalized embeddings |
| index_type | `hnsw` | low-latency recall for mixed query loads |
| ef_construction | `128` | better recall for nuanced pricing language |
| ef_search | `64` | good balance between speed and quality |

## Collection Design

| Namespace | Contents | Why |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| `offers` | tiers, bundles, annual plans, add-ons | highest-frequency monetization retrieval |
| `proof` | case studies, metrics, testimonials, benchmarks | persuasion support |
| `competitive` | rival pricing and positioning | strategic response |
| `retention` | renewal saves, churn triggers, downgrade defenses | protects existing revenue |
| `icp` | segment patterns and qualification logic | keeps premium relevance high |

## Metadata Indexing

| Field | Indexed | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| revenue_stage | yes | stage-aware filtering |
| segment_value | yes | premium and enterprise retrieval precision |
| offer_type | yes | plan-specific lookup |
| margin_sensitivity | yes | protect high-margin motions |
| source_class | yes | separate internal proof from competitor intel |
| freshness_date | yes | demote stale evidence |

## Operational Rules

| Rule ID | Trigger | Action | Commercial Reason |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| VS01 | dimension mismatch detected | reject write | corrupted search is worse than no search |
| VS02 | stale competitor corpus | reindex namespace only | spend should target changed value surfaces |
| VS03 | enterprise proposal run | warm cache for `offers` and `proof` | faster premium-path generation |
| VS04 | local dev session | allow FAISS mirror reads only | cheap testing without polluting prod |
| VS05 | metadata missing | write to quarantine queue, not main collection | untyped vectors reduce commercial trust |

## Why pgvector Wins

| Factor | pgvector | Why N06 Prefers It |
|--------|----------|--------------------|
| metadata filters | strong | commercial search is filter-heavy |
| operational simplicity | high | one fewer separate system to babysit |
| transactional writes | native | index updates can align with content publishing |
| local parity | moderate | dev and prod can share SQL idioms |
| cost profile | efficient at current scale | greed likes boring infra with good unit economics |

## Rationale

| Design Choice | Why It Exists | Strategic Greed Impact |
|---------------|---------------|------------------------|
| pgvector over managed niche store | N06 does not need premium infra tax before premium scale exists | better margin discipline |
| namespace split | retrieval quality collapses if every surface shares one pile | keeps decisions crisp |
| metadata mandatory | semantic similarity alone cannot reason about business stage | preserves cash relevance |
| HNSW index | enough speed for interactive use | supports commercial workflows without overpaying |
| FAISS mirror only for dev | local speed is useful, but prod truth should stay governed | limits ops drift |

## Example

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| N06 adds new annual bundle proof and updates competitor pricing notes | only `offers`, `proof`, and `competitive` namespaces reindex, while retention corpus stays untouched |

```yaml
backend: pgvector
collection: n06_commercial_knowledge
dimensions: 1024
distance_metric: cosine
index_type: hnsw
ef_construction: 128
ef_search: 64
```

## Risk Controls

| Risk | Guard |
|------|-------|
| mixed namespaces in one query | require namespace filter in retriever profile |
| silent vector drift | pin dimension and model tuple in index metadata |
| stale proof claims | freshness filter and scheduled demotion |
| operational sprawl | keep FAISS out of production write path |

| Kind | `vector_store` |
| Primary Backend | `pgvector` |
| Index Type | `hnsw` |
| Dimensions | 1024 |
