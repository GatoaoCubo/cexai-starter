# N06 Commercial Controlled Vocabulary

## Purpose

Canonical controlled vocabulary for N06 Commercial nucleus. Loaded at F2b SPEAK before every artifact generation. Prevents semantic drift, enforces industry-standard terminology, and enables precise LLM-to-LLM communication across nuclei.

## Canonical Terms

| Term | Definition | N06 Application | Anti-pattern |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **unit_economics** | Revenue, cost, and margin metrics per customer unit | Evaluate CAC/LTV per tier and channel to validate acquisition strategy | "per customer numbers", "customer economics" |
| **LTV_CAC_ratio** | Lifetime Value divided by Customer Acquisition Cost; healthy SaaS: >3x | Primary signal for acquisition channel viability; below 3x = acquisition unsustainable | "value over cost", "ROI on customers" |
| **payback_period** | Months to recover CAC from gross margin; healthy SaaS: <12 months | Determines how aggressively to invest in paid acquisition | "time to ROI", "breakeven" |
| **MRR** | Monthly Recurring Revenue; sum of all active subscription amounts normalized to monthly | Primary revenue KPI; excludes one-time fees, trials, paused subscriptions | "monthly revenue", "subscription income" |
| **ARR** | Annual Recurring Revenue; MRR * 12 or sum of annual commitments | Milestone metric for funding conversations and enterprise sales | "annual revenue" |
| **churn_rate** | Percentage of customers (or MRR) lost in a period; monthly = churned/start * 100 | Core retention health metric; <2% monthly target for N06 | "cancellation rate", "dropout rate" |
| **expansion_revenue** | MRR gained from upgrades and seat additions from existing customers | Measures how well N06's expansion plays work; target >20% of new MRR | "upsell revenue", "upgrade MRR" |
| **net_revenue_retention** | (MRR_end - churn + expansion - contraction) / MRR_start * 100 | NRR > 100% means base grows without new acquisition; holy grail >110% | "dollar retention", "net dollar retention" |
| **pricing_psychology** | Behavioral economics applied to price perception and packaging decisions | Used when designing tier anchoring, annual framing ("months free" vs "% off"), feature gating | "pricing tricks", "price games" |
| **value_metric** | The unit customers pay for that scales naturally with their usage | For CEX: builds/month; determines where to put usage limits and expansion triggers | "usage metric", "billing unit" |
| **good_better_best_packaging** | Three-tier pricing architecture where each tier is a credible upgrade for a defined persona | N06's FREE/STARTER/PRO/ENTERPRISE implements this with persona-specific feature gates | "tiered pricing", "3-tier model" |
| **freemium_conversion** | Rate at which free users convert to paid; healthy: 2-5% (PLG) to 8-15% (hybrid) | Measures effectiveness of free tier design; requires clear value wall | "free to paid rate" |
| **product_led_growth** | Go-to-market where the product itself is the primary acquisition and retention driver | FREE tier design and in-app upgrade prompts are N06's PLG layer | "PLG", "self-serve growth" |
| **sales_assisted** | Revenue acquired through direct sales process (CSM, demo, proposal) | Used for ENTERPRISE tier and large PRO accounts; complements PLG | "sales-led", "high-touch" |
| **land_and_expand** | Close a small initial deal, then grow account revenue through expansion plays | N06 strategy: STARTER entry, expand to PRO via quota hits, then Enterprise via SSO/seats | "start small and grow", "foot in the door" |
| **JTBD** | Jobs To Be Done: the underlying goal a customer is hiring your product to accomplish | Used in discovery to identify true pain (not stated feature request, but underlying job) | "customer needs", "use cases" |
| **willingness_to_pay** | Maximum price a customer segment will pay before switching; measured via van Westendorp or conjoint | Informs tier price points; N06 tests via pricing page A/B and conversation probing | "price sensitivity", "price ceiling" |
| **price_elasticity** | Degree to which demand changes with price; elastic = price-sensitive, inelastic = price-insensitive | Enterprise buyers are more inelastic; indie users highly elastic -- informs discount strategy | "price sensitivity" |
| **competitive_moat** | Sustainable advantage that prevents competitors from eroding market share | CEX moat: 257-kind taxonomy + 8F pipeline + typed knowledge infrastructure -- not replicable | "competitive advantage", "defensibility" |
| **ideal_customer_profile** | Specific company and persona characteristics that predict high LTV and low CAC | N06 ICP scoring in entity_memory uses 5 dimensions; score < 33 = disqualify | "ICP", "target customer", "best fit customer" |
| **total_addressable_market** | Maximum revenue opportunity if 100% market share; used for growth planning | N06 uses TAM to prioritize vertical expansion plays and pricing ceiling | "TAM", "market size" |
| **revenue_operations** | Cross-functional alignment of sales, marketing, and CS ops to maximize revenue efficiency | N06 is N06's RevOps layer within CEX: data, process, tooling | "RevOps", "growth operations" |
| **intent_resolution** | NLU mapping of free-text user input to a structured action tuple (intent, entities, confidence) before routing to a workflow | Acquisition lever: powers funnel routing on pricing pages and inbound chat -- routes "want enterprise SSO" to enterprise_quote vs self-serve checkout, lifting demo-request conversion and shortening time-to-CAC payback; logged in expansion_play_n06.md triggers | "intent matching", "figuring out what the lead wants", "auto-classifying inbound" |
| **named_entity_recognition** | Sequence-labeling task that extracts typed entities (ORG, PERSON, MONEY, PRODUCT) from unstructured text with token-level F1 typically >0.85 on domain-tuned models | Cost lever: enriches entity_memory_customer.md from emails/calls/CRM notes to auto-populate ICP scoring fields (company_size, budget_signal, competitor_mentioned), cutting SDR manual research labor and improving NRR via earlier expansion_play targeting | "lead scraping", "pulling info from emails", "auto-tagging accounts" |
| **topological_sort** | DAG ordering algorithm (Kahn's, O(V+E)) that returns a linear sequence respecting all prerequisite edges, failing fast on cycles | Expansion lever: orders upsell-path dependencies in expansion_play_n06.md so seat-expansion precedes tier-upgrade precedes module add-on, preventing churn signals from premature asks and maximizing per-account expansion_revenue without willingness_to_pay damage | "upgrade roadmap", "upsell sequence", "next best offer" |

## Cross-Nucleus Origin (N04 Propagation 2026-05-02)

These three terms (intent_resolution, named_entity_recognition, topological_sort) originated in N04_knowledge's controlled vocabulary and were propagated into N06_commercial via the cross-nucleus refresh on 2026-05-02. Strategic Greed selection criterion: each term must map to a measurable revenue, cost, or expansion lever already present in N06 artifacts. Three N04 terms were rejected (wikilink_integrity, cross_reference_density, xref_proposal) -- they are graph-internal plumbing N06 consumes via retrieval but does not document in its commercial vocabulary.

## Domain-Specific Extensions (N06 Only)

| Term | Definition | CEX-Specific Usage |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **strategic_greed** | N06's sin lens: optimize every commercial decision for maximum revenue leverage | Drives N06's artifact selection: always ask "what's the ROI per hour of artifact build?" |
| **commercial_portfolio** | The set of N06 artifacts providing full commercial coverage across pillars | Gap analysis drives self-assembly: identify which commercial scenarios lack artifact coverage |
| **revenue_architecture** | The designed system of tiers, pricing, triggers, and flows that generates compound revenue | Refers to the full N06 artifact set working together as a system, not individual artifacts |
| **expansion_play** | Specific trigger event paired with a response action designed to drive tier upgrade | N06's expansion_play_n06.md maps 15+ triggers to automated or CSM-driven responses |
| **churn_signal** | Observable customer behavior indicating elevated risk of cancellation | N06 tracks 12 behavioral + financial signals in entity_memory_customer.md |
| **save_rate** | Percentage of churn-intent customers successfully retained; target >40% | Measures effectiveness of churn_prevention_playbook interventions |

## Cross-Nucleus Shared Terms (DO NOT REDEFINE)

These terms are defined in N00_genesis and must not be redefined in N06 KCs:
- `8F pipeline (F1-F8)`: canonical reasoning protocol
- `kind`: atomic artifact type from the 257-kind taxonomy
- `pillar`: P01-P12 domain grouping
- `nucleus`: N00-N07 operational agent
- `quality_gate`: F7 GOVERN validation
- `signal`: F8 COLLABORATE completion notification
- `entity_memory`: typed memory artifact for persistent entity state
- `knowledge_card`: canonical document artifact for domain knowledge
