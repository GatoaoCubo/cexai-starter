tldr: "5 AI SaaS pricing models benchmarked: per-token ($0.002/tok, 89% adoption), seat-based ($12.50/user/mo, 61%), usage-based (72% adoption, highest complexity), freemium (5% conversion rate, strong LTV), enterprise ($150K/yr, 48% adoption). Usage-based dominates AI because cost correlates with value delivered."
when_to_use: "When choosing a pricing model for an AI-powered product, designing tier structures for API access, evaluating freemium vs usage-based economics, or benchmarking against industry adoption rates."

axioms:
  - "ALWAYS match pricing model to value delivery mechanism — per-token for API, seat for collaboration, usage for analytics."
  - "NEVER default to flat-rate for AI products — variable cost structure demands variable pricing."
  - "Freemium conversion below 3% signals product-market fit gap, not pricing gap."

# AI SaaS Monetization Models

## Core Models
1. **Per-Token Pricing**: Charge per API request/token (e.g., chatbot services). OpenAI charges $0.002 per token for GPT-3.5, generating $1.2M/month at 100M tokens. Scalable for high-volume users but risky for low-usage clients.
2. **Seat-Based**: Monthly/yearly user licenses (e.g., enterprise collaboration tools). Slack charges $12.50/user/month for premium plans, with 100k+ companies using it. Scalable but limited by user growth.
3. **Usage-Based**: Tiered pricing by feature/function (e.g., analytics platforms). Google Analytics offers free tier with $100/month for advanced features. High revenue potential but complex to implement.
4. **Freemium**: Free tier with premium upgrades (e.g., AI coding assistants). Grammarly converts 5% of free users to paid ($12/month), achieving 200k+ paid subscribers. High CAC but strong LTV.
5. **Enterprise Tiers**: Custom pricing for large organizations (e.g., customer success platforms). Salesforce offers $150k/year for its AI modules, targeting Fortune 500 clients. High margins but long sales cycles.
