# /monitor -- Autonomous Dispatch Monitoring

Invoke the monitor skill for dispatch health checking.

See: `.claude/skills/monitor.md`

## Usage

1. `/monitor` -- run a single health check cycle (process liveness + git log + signals)
2. Auto-invoked by N07 after every `dispatch.sh solo|grid|crew|swarm`
3. Interleaved during active dispatch: N07 polls every 60-90s between own tasks

## What It Checks

| Check | Command | Detects |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Process liveness | `Get-Process claude, codex, node -EA SilentlyContinue` | RUNNING / CRASHED / ORPHAN |
| Recent commits | `git log --oneline --since="5 minutes ago"` | Progress from nuclei |
| Completion signals | `ls .cex/runtime/signals/` | Nucleus done notifications |
| Task file consumption | `ls .cex/runtime/handoffs/n0*_task.md` | Boot failures |

## Invocation

When the user types `/monitor`, invoke the skill:

```
Skill(skill="monitor")
```

## Cross-runtime

- **Claude Code**: native skill + this command
- **Codex/Gemini/Ollama**: boot wrapper loads `.cex/skills/monitor.md` as context
