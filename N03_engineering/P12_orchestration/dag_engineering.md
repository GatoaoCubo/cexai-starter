## Nodes

| Node | Input | Output | Deterministic |
|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| F1 | kind name | constraints | Yes |
| F2 | kind name | builder identity | Yes |
| F3 | kind name | knowledge context | Yes |
| F4 | F1+F2+F3 | construction plan | No (LLM) |
| F5 | kind name | tools + existing | Yes |
| F6 | F4+F5 | artifact text | No (LLM) |
| F7 | F6 output | pass/fail + score | Yes |
| F8 | F7 pass | saved path | Yes |

## Edges

All sequential. F6->F7->F6 is the only cycle (retry).
Max cycle: 2. After 2 retries, F7 emits HARD FAIL.

## Parallelism

- Within single artifact: none (strict sequential)
- Across artifacts: full parallel via batch dispatch
- Across nuclei: full parallel via spawn grid

## Cycle Exception: F6-F7 Retry Loop

The graph is acyclic except for the controlled F6->F7->F6 retry edge. This is not
a general cycle -- it is a bounded retry with hard termination:

| Attempt | Trigger | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 1st | F7 returns SOFT FAIL | F6 re-generates with issues list injected |
| 2nd | F7 returns SOFT FAIL again | F6 re-generates with both prior issues |
| 3rd | F7 returns anything < 8.0 | HARD FAIL -- no more retries, error signal |

## Cross-Artifact Parallelism

| Scope | Max Concurrent | Coordination |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| Single artifact | 1 (sequential F1-F8) | None needed |
| Batch same-kind | 6 (configurable) | Independent -- no shared state |
| Multi-nucleus grid | 6 nuclei | Signal-based via .cex/runtime/signals/ |

## Multi-Nucleus DAG Example

```
N01 research ---.
                 +--> N03 build --> N05 test --> N07 consolidate
N04 knowledge ---'
```

Each node is a full 8F pipeline run. Inter-node edges are handoff files.
