# Golden Examples for Builder

## Pattern 1: Agent (quality 9.5)

**Why golden**: Complete frontmatter, all sections filled, boundaries table, immediately usable.

Frontmatter pattern: id=p02_agent_{{name}}, kind=agent, pillar=P02
capabilities_count and tools_count are ACTUAL counts, never placeholders.
tldr is one sentence telling exactly what this agent does.

Body: Identity > Capabilities (numbered) > Tools (table) > Routing > Boundaries (Does/NOT table) > Crew Role

## Pattern 2: Knowledge Card (quality 9.3)

**Why golden**: Dense, searchable, no filler, spec block with actual constraints.

Frontmatter: when_to_use and keywords fields are critical for discoverability.
feeds_kinds lists which artifact kinds consume this KC.

Body: Spec (yaml) > Definition > When to Use > Boundaries > Relations > Anti-Patterns

## Pattern 3: Workflow (quality 9.1)

**Why golden**: Every step has agent, input, output, signal, depends_on.

steps_count is actual count. execution is sequential/parallel/mixed.
signals lists ALL signals emitted across all steps.

Body: Purpose > Steps (Agent/Input/Output/Signal/Depends each) > Quality Gates > Signals

## What Makes Golden

1. ZERO placeholder values in frontmatter (no null, no Pending finalization)
2. Every section has 3+ lines of substantive content
3. Tables have real data, not example rows
4. Density >= 0.90
5. Compiles to valid YAML without warnings


## Example Quality Standards

Few-shot examples must demonstrate the exact output format expected by the builder:

- **Input completeness**: every example includes full context, not abbreviated placeholders
- **Output fidelity**: example outputs pass the same quality gate as production artifacts
- **Edge case coverage**: at least one example per category shows boundary conditions
- **Negative examples**: include at least one counter-example showing what NOT to produce

### Calibration Protocol

```yaml
# Few-shot calibration checklist
calibration:
  min_examples: 3
  max_examples: 7
  diversity_check: true
  format_match: exact
  quality_floor: 8.5
  refresh_cycle: monthly
```

| Dimension | Requirement | Verification |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Format match | Output matches schema exactly | Automated parse test |
| Domain accuracy | Content is factually correct | Peer review by domain expert |
| Difficulty spread | Easy + medium + hard examples | Manual classification |
| Length distribution | Examples span 50%-150% of target | Automated word count |
