# N03 Software Engineering — Master KC

## What N03 Knows (After Verticalization)

### Layer 1: Meta-Construction (Bootstrap — Already Had)
- 8F Pipeline (F1→F8) — mandatory for every artifact
- 11 Construction Laws (3 layers: Foundation/Execution/Quality)
- 3-Phase Build Protocol (pre-flight/execute/synthesize)
- 300 kinds, 300+ builders, kind resolution via Motor
- Quality gates (H01-H07, 12LP, 5D rubric)

### Layer 2: Software Engineering (NEW — This Mission)
- **Python project structure**: pyproject.toml, hatchling, src layout, CLI entry points
- **Testing**: pytest fixtures, conftest, parametrize, markers, coverage
- **Linting**: Ruff (lint+format), mypy (types), pre-commit hooks
- **Containerization**: Multi-stage Docker, compose, non-root, healthcheck
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (11 workflow patterns from codexa-core)
- **Deploy**: Railway, Render, nixpacks, Procfile
- **Security**: 5-layer scanning (deps, secrets, SAST, container, CodeQL)
- **Code review**: 7-dimension rubric, GitHub MCP, PR validation
- **Error handling**: Exception hierarchy, retry, circuit breaker, structured logging
- **API patterns**: FastAPI middleware stack, Pydantic models, dependency injection

### Layer 3: Self-Knowledge (NEW — CEX Tooling)
- 23 CEX tools documented (was 4/23, now 23/23)
- Tool dependency graph understood
- Can explain/modify/extend any CEX tool

## Capability Matrix

| Task | KC Source | Builder Step |
|------|----------|-------------|
| "scaffold Python project" | kc_python_project_structure | SCAFFOLD (step 2) |
| "implement FastAPI service" | kc_fastapi_patterns | IMPLEMENT (step 3) |
| "write pytest tests" | kc_pytest_patterns | TEST (step 4) |
| "configure Ruff linting" | kc_ruff_uv | LINT (step 5) |
| "create Dockerfile" | kc_docker_patterns | DOCKER (step 6) |
| "setup GitHub Actions CI" | kc_github_actions | CI (step 7) |
| "deploy to Railway" | kc_deploy_paas | DEPLOY (step 8) |
| "review PR on GitHub" | kc_code_review | REVIEW (step 9) |
| "add security scanning" | kc_security_practices | CI (security job) |
| "handle errors properly" | kc_error_handling_python | IMPLEMENT (error layer) |
| "validate data models" | kc_pydantic_patterns | IMPLEMENT (models) |
| "setup pre-commit hooks" | kc_git_hooks_ci | LINT (hooks) |

## Cross-Nucleus Service Map

```
N01 says: "implement research pipeline"
  → N03 reads: bld_instruction_research_pipeline + kc_fastapi_patterns
  → N03 outputs: src/research_pipeline/ + tests/ + Dockerfile + CI

N02 says: "implement social publisher"
  → N03 reads: bld_instruction_social_publisher + kc_python_project_structure
  → N03 outputs: src/social_publisher/ + tests/ + Dockerfile + CI

N04 says: "deploy Supabase migrations"
  → N03 reads: kc_supabase_database + kc_deploy_paas
  → N03 runs: supabase db push + health check

N07 says: "add --batch flag to 8F runner"
  → N03 reads: kc_cex_tooling_master + kc_cex_8f_runner
  → N03 modifies: _tools/cex_8f_runner.py + tests
```

## Anti-Patterns

- Applying this artifact without understanding the domain context
- Treating this as a standalone reference without checking linked artifacts
- Ignoring version constraints when integrating
