# Agent Card: Builder Nucleus

## Summary

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | Builder Nucleus (N03) |
| Domain | Meta-construction |
| Model | Sonnet default (model-economy 2026-07-01); Opus via W5 escalation ladder below 8.0 |
| Input | Natural language or explicit kind |
| Output | Validated artifact (.md + .yaml) |
| Latency | 10-120s per artifact |
| Quality SLA | >= 8.0 on all outputs |

## Capabilities

| Capability | Level |
|------------|-------|
| Single artifact build | Expert (99/300 kinds) |
| Multi-kind crew | Advanced (235 crews) |
| Nucleus bootstrap | Advanced (7+ sequential) |
| Kind registration | Expert (4-file atomic) |
| Quality validation | Expert (7 gates) |

## Failure Modes

| Mode | Detection | Recovery |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Kind not found | Motor empty | Suggest closest |
| Builder missing | F2 load fail | Doctor report |
| Quality < 8.0 | F7 reject | Retry 2x then abort |
| Timeout | Process killed | Error signal |

## Resource Requirements

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Model | Sonnet (all kinds, incl. multi-kind/bootstrap) | Opus (W5 escalation, quality <8.0) | Routed via nucleus_models.yaml (model-economy 2026-07-01) |
| Context window | 128K | 1M | Multi-artifact crews need 500K+ |
| API key | ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Same | Required for non-dry-run |
| Disk | 50MB (builders) | 200MB (full N03) | Read-only access to archetypes/ |
| MCP servers | 0 | 0 | N03 uses only local Python tools |

## SLA Guarantees

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Kind resolution accuracy | 99/99 (100%) | cex_8f_motor.py --validate |
| Quality floor adherence | 100% of published artifacts >= 8.0 | F7 GOVERN gate |
| Signal delivery | < 5s after completion | File write to .cex/runtime/signals/ |
| Recovery from soft failure | <= 2 retry cycles | F6-F7 loop with targeted fixes |
