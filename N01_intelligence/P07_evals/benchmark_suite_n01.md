<!-- 8F: F1 constrain=P07/benchmark_suite F4 reason=Analytical Envy is not self-congratulatory -- N01 must benchmark its own performance against ground truth and competing approaches F8 collaborate=N01_intelligence/P07_evals/benchmark_suite_n01.md -->

## Purpose

N01 claims Analytical Envy -- this suite proves it.
Five benchmark categories test whether N01 research outperforms:
1. Naive LLM research (no structured pipeline)
2. Web search + manual synthesis (baseline)
3. Commercial intelligence tools (industry standard)

## Benchmark Categories

### B1: Competitive Analysis Accuracy

| Test | Measure | Ground Truth |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Pricing accuracy | exact price match vs. verified pricing | official pricing page snapshot |
| Feature comparison | feature matrix accuracy | product documentation |
| Market share | estimated vs. analyst report | analyst consensus |
| Headcount | estimate vs. verified public count | LinkedIn or equivalent verified count |
| Funding total | vs. public funding database | Crunchbase or equivalent verified |

Target: > 85% accuracy on verifiable facts.
Metric: precision@5 (top 5 claims verified).

### B2: Source Retrieval Quality

| Test | Measure | Method |
|------|---------|--------|
| Recall@10 | % relevant sources in top 10 | human-labeled relevance |
| MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) | first relevant result position | TREC eval standard |
| Freshness | % sources < 30 days for current-events queries | date verification |
| Triangulation rate | % claims with >= 3 sources | automated count |

Target: Recall@10 > 0.80, MRR > 0.75.

### B3: Synthesis Depth

| Test | Measure | Comparator |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Analytical depth | structured depth rubric score | naive LLM baseline |
| Novel insight rate | % insights not in any single source | human judgment |
| Causal chain present | mechanistic explanation vs. description | rubric score |

Target: depth score > 2 points above naive LLM baseline.

### B4: Bias Detection Accuracy

| Test | Measure | Method |
|------|---------|--------|
| True positive bias detection | correctly identified biases | human-annotated bias corpus |
| False positive rate | non-biased flagged as biased | human-annotated clean corpus |
| Bias type precision | correct bias classification | ground truth labels |

Target: bias detection precision > 0.80, recall > 0.75.

### B5: Time-to-Insight

| Test | Measure | Baseline |
|------|---------|---------|
| Competitive brief | time for 5-competitor analysis | human analyst: 4 hours |
| Market sizing | time for TAM/SAM/SOM estimate | human analyst: 2 hours |
| Literature review | time for 20-paper synthesis | human analyst: 3 hours |

Target: N01 produces equivalent output in < 15 min for each task.

## Benchmark Dataset

| Category | Test Cases | Labeled By | Update Frequency |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| B1 Competitive | 20 companies | N07 + N01 cross-validated | quarterly |
| B2 Retrieval | 50 queries | human relevance judges | semi-annually |
| B3 Synthesis | 15 research tasks | N07 with rubric | quarterly |
| B4 Bias | 40 annotated reports | N01 self-annotated + N07 review | semi-annually |
| B5 Speed | 10 tasks | wall-clock + output quality | monthly |

## Performance Scorecard

| Category | Current | Target | vs. Naive LLM | vs. Web+Manual |
|----------|---------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| B1 Accuracy | TBD | > 85% | +20-30pp | parity |
| B2 Recall@10 | TBD | > 0.80 | +0.25-0.35 | parity |
| B3 Depth | TBD | > 7.5 | +2.0 | +0.5 |
| B4 Bias precision | TBD | > 0.80 | +0.40 | N/A |
| B5 Speed (min) | TBD | < 15 | 10x faster | 10x faster |

_[TBD values populated after the first benchmark run against your own corpus.]_
