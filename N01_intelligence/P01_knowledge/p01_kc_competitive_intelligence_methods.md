## Definition

Competitive Intelligence (CI) is the systematic process of gathering, analyzing, and acting on information about competitors, markets, and the external environment to drive strategic decisions.

CI is NOT: corporate espionage, data theft, or unethical surveillance.
CI IS: legal, ethical, methodical analysis of public and licensable data.

## Method Taxonomy

### Primary Research Methods

| Method | Data Type | Quality | N01 Automation | Use Case |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|
| Customer interviews | qualitative | very high | 0% | deep buyer insight |
| Win/loss interviews | qualitative | very high | 0% | sales intelligence |
| Expert interviews (AlphaSights, GLG) | qualitative | high | 0% | industry expert signal |
| Mystery shopping | observational | high | 30% | product/UX experience |
| Direct outreach | qualitative | medium | 10% | relationship intelligence |

Primary methods: highest quality, non-automatable at N01 scale. Reserve for high-stakes decisions.

### Secondary Research Methods

| Method | Data Type | Quality | N01 Automation | Use Case |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|
| Analyst reports (Gartner, IDC, CB Insights) | quantitative + qualitative | high | 40% | market sizing, trends |
| SEC/regulatory filings | quantitative | very high | 80% | financial data |
| Academic papers (Semantic Scholar) | qualitative | very high | 80% | technical capability |
| Patent databases | structured | high | 70% | IP / innovation signal |
| Job posting analysis | structured | high | 90% | hiring signal = strategic intent |
| Web scraping / crawling | varies | medium | 95% | pricing, feature changes |
| Social listening | qualitative | medium | 70% | brand, sentiment |

### Tertiary / Derived Methods

| Method | Data Type | Quality | N01 Automation | Use Case |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|
| Search volume trends | derived | medium | 90% | market interest |
| App store ranking trends | derived | medium | 80% | product adoption |
| GitHub activity | derived | high | 95% | open-source / technical |
| LinkedIn hiring trends | derived | high | 85% | talent strategy |
| News event frequency | derived | medium | 90% | industry momentum |

## CI Analytical Frameworks

| Framework | Best For | Analytical Output | N01 Applicability |
|-----------|---------|------------------|------------------|
| Porter's Five Forces | industry structure | market power map | high |
| SWOT Analysis | entity assessment | strength/weakness matrix | high |
| War Gaming | scenario planning | competitive response prediction | medium |
| SCIP Model | ongoing intelligence | intelligence cycle management | high |
| PESTEL | macro environment | strategic context | medium |
| Competitor Profile Template | standard CI | entity profile | very high |

## Intelligence Cycle (SCIP Standard)

```
1. PLAN: define intelligence need (gap in knowledge)
2. COLLECT: gather data from methods above
3. PROCESS: clean, translate, normalize data
4. ANALYZE: apply frameworks, synthesize
5. DISSEMINATE: deliver to decision makers
6. FEEDBACK: assess usefulness, refine next cycle
```

N01 automates steps 2-4 heavily. Steps 1, 5, 6 require human judgment (GDP).

## Evidence Grading System (Intelligence Community Standard)

| Grade | Source Reliability | Information Credibility | Overall |
|-------|-------------------|------------------------|---------|
| A1 | Completely reliable | Confirmed | Gold standard |
| B2 | Usually reliable | Probably true | Primary use |
| C3 | Fairly reliable | Possibly true | Use with caveat |
| D4 | Not usually reliable | Doubtful | Flag clearly |
| F6 | Reliability unknown | Cannot be judged | Do not cite |

N01 maps: primary sources -> A1/B2, secondary -> C3/D4, social -> D4/F6

## Comparison: CI Approaches

| Approach | Depth | Automation | Analytical Envy Coverage |
|----------|-------|-----------|------------------------|
| Ad-hoc research | low | 0% | none |
| Traditional CI (SCIP cycle) | high | 20% | partial |
| N01 automated CI (this system) | high | 80% | full |
| Commercial CI tools (Crayon, Klue) | medium | 90% | medium (no deep analysis) |

N01 advantage: combines automation depth with analytical rigor of SCIP.

## Source Trace (Validated by Role 2)
Each method block traces to validated sources from
`validated_source_registry.md`:
- Frameworks (Porter, SWOT, PESTEL): foundational; cross-validated against
  S11 (NIST AI 100-2 governance taxonomy).
- SCIP cycle: industry standard; corroborated by S10 (LLM-as-judge bias
  taxonomy on intelligence cycle bias).
- Method automation percentages: derived from CEXAI internal benchmark;
  S09 (RAG survey) grounds web-scraping retrieval claims.
