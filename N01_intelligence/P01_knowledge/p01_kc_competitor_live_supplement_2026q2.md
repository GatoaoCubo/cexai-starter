when_to_use: "When any competitor KC contradicts this supplement (this wins -- fresher data); when preparing competitive positioning materials; when verifying framework health status before recommending integrations; when user asks for current market landscape"
axioms:
 - "ALWAYS treat this supplement as authoritative over individual competitor KCs when data conflicts -- scrape timestamp (2026-04-24) is the freshness proof"
 - "ALWAYS verify against at least 2 sources before accepting any metric -- Analytical Envy demands competitive context, not single-source trust"
 - "NEVER cite DORMANT frameworks (MetaGPT, AutoGen) as active competitors without the dormancy qualifier -- misleading positioning damages N01 credibility"
 - "NEVER extrapolate 30-day commit velocity to long-term health -- OpenClaw's 13K commits/30d could be pre-launch sprint, not sustainable pace"
tldr: "Live-verified competitive intelligence supplement (April 24, 2026) via GitHub API + Firecrawl deep scrape: 10 frameworks tracked, 363K-4K star range, 3 dormant projects identified, 2 major security events documented, and market valued at $7.84B growing 46% CAGR to $52.6B by 2030."

## 2. Project Health Deep Dive

### 2.1 DORMANT: MetaGPT

| Signal | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Last commit | January 21, 2026 (93 days ago) |
| Last release | v0.8.2 (March 2025 -- 13 months ago) |
| 30d commits | ~0 |
| Contributors | 148 (no growth) |
| Org rename | geekan/MetaGPT -> FoundationAgents/MetaGPT |

**Assessment:** MetaGPT is effectively abandoned. The org rename to "FoundationAgents" suggests a pivot or handoff. No releases in 13 months. Open issues (126) are low only because new users stopped filing them. CEX should NOT position against MetaGPT -- it is no longer a competitive threat.

### 2.2 DORMANT: AutoGen

| Signal | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Last release | python-v0.7.5 (September 2025 -- 7 months ago) |
| 30d commits | 2 (effectively zero) |
| License | CC-BY-4.0 (non-standard for code) |
| Successor | Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF) = AutoGen + Semantic Kernel merger |
| Fork | AG2 (community fork, separate roadmap) |

**Assessment:** AutoGen is in official maintenance mode. Microsoft is merging it with Semantic Kernel into "Microsoft Agent Framework" (MAF). The community forked as AG2 with its own beta roadmap. Two divergent lineages create confusion. High star count (57K) is legacy -- new adopters should choose MAF or AG2, not AutoGen.

**CEX angle vs AutoGen/AG2:** Position as "what AutoGen tried to be, but with typed knowledge and multi-runtime" -- the research-style multi-agent paradigm executed with governance.

### 2.3 HYPER-ACTIVE: OpenClaw

| Signal | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 30d commits | 13,158 (440/day average) |
| Open issues | 18,009 (overwhelming) |
| Stars velocity | +28K in ~2 weeks |
| Security CVEs | 5+ critical/high in 2026 alone |

**Assessment:** OpenClaw has massive momentum but equally massive security debt. 18K open issues signals a project growing faster than its maintainers can govern. The non-profit foundation post-Steinberger is struggling to keep pace.


| Signal | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 30d commits | 3,202 (107/day average) |
| Stars growth | 47K -> 115K in weeks (145% jump) |
| Open issues | 6,791 (growing fast) |
| Key differentiator | Self-improving via persistent skills (Markdown files) |

## 3. Security Intelligence (Firecrawl: Sangfor, SentinelOne, NVD)

### 3.1 OpenClaw CVE Registry (2026)

| CVE | Severity | Type | Description |
|-----|----------|------|-------------|
| CVE-2026-25253 | High (CVSS 8.8) | Token Theft | WebSocket gatewayUrl injection; attacker steals stored auth tokens |
| CVE-2026-24763 | Critical | RCE | Remote command execution via command injection |
| CVE-2026-26322 | High | SSRF | Server-side request forgery enabling internal system exploitation |
| CVE-2026-26329 | Medium | Path Traversal | Local file exposure via path traversal |
| CVE-2026-30741 | Critical | Prompt Injection | Code execution via injected commands in prompts |
| CVE-2026-6011 | High | SSRF | Server-side request forgery (SentinelOne-documented) |
| CVE-2026-33579 | High | Privilege Escalation | /pair approve command fails to forward caller scopes |

**Exposure stats (February 2026):**
- 40,214 internet-exposed OpenClaw instances identified
- 35.4% flagged as vulnerable
- 63% of observed deployments considered vulnerable (Infosecurity Magazine)
- ~20% of ClawHub skills contained malicious payloads (Cisco AI Security Team)

**CEX positioning opportunity:** OpenClaw's security record is CEX's strongest competitive wedge for enterprise buyers. Every CVE above maps to a CEX governance feature: 8F pipeline prevents unvalidated artifacts, H01-H07 quality gates block malicious contributions, N07 orchestration prevents unauthorized tool execution.


| Risk | Details |
|------|---------|
| Skill poisoning | User-generated skills can contain malicious code; no review gate |
| Sensitive data exposure | Learning loop stores task outcomes that may contain secrets |
| No auditability | No compliance features for regulated workloads |
| Costly learning loop | Self-improvement on expensive models (GPT-4, Claude) burns tokens |

## 4. Feature Intelligence (Firecrawl: competitor sites + blogs)

### 4.1 CrewAI 2026 Release Cadence

| Version | Date | Key Features |
|---------|------|--------------|
| v1.8.0 | Jan 8, 2026 | Native async A2A chain, streaming tool calls, production Flows, HITL |
| v1.9.0 | Jan 26, 2026 | Structured outputs/response_format, Keycloak SSO, multimodal files |
| v1.10.0 | Feb 26, 2026 | Enhanced MCP tool resolution, LanceDB upgrade, httpx migration |
| v1.11.0 | Mar 18, 2026 | Plan-execute pattern, Plus API token auth, flow_structure |
| v1.12.0 | Mar 25, 2026 | Qdrant Edge memory, Arabic docs, OpenRouter/DeepSeek native |
| v1.13.0 | Apr 2, 2026 | A2UI extension, unified RuntimeState, GPT-5.x support, AMP tool metadata |

| v1.14.3 | Apr 24, 2026 | Lifecycle events, e2b support, Azure credential fallback, Bedrock V4, Daytona sandbox |

**Velocity:** 8 feature releases in 108 days = one release every 13.5 days. This is aggressive for an enterprise framework.

### 4.2 CrewAI Business Intelligence

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total executions | 2B+ (up from 1.4B in KC) | ET30 blog + NVIDIA article, Mar 2026 |
| Fortune 500 adoption | ~60% | Official claim (unchanged) |
| Global presence | 150+ countries | ET30 blog |
| Enterprise Tech 30 | Selected 2nd consecutive year (Mar 31, 2026) | Voted by 98 investors, 85 firms, $2.6T AUM |
| NVIDIA partnership | NemoClaw deep integration (Mar 17, 2026) | Zero-code sandboxed execution, DGX Station + Nemotron |
| Konecta alliance | Lead consulting/implementation partner | BusinessWire, Nov 2025 |
| PwC | Global Agent OS powered by CrewAI | Jul 2025, still active |

### 4.3 CrewAI Pricing (Verified Jan 2026, Lindy comparison)

| Tier | Price/mo | Executions/mo | Deployed Crews | Seats |
|------|----------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Free | $0 | 50 | 1 | 1 |
| Basic | $99 | 100 | 2 | 5 |
| Standard | $500 | 1,000 | 2 | Unlimited |
| Pro | $1,000 | 2,000 | 5 | Unlimited |
| Enterprise | Contact | 10,000 | 10 | Unlimited |
| Ultra | Contact | 500,000 | 25 | Unlimited + VPC |

**Note:** This is more granular than the existing KC's 2-tier model (Free + Enterprise). The existing KC data came from crewai.com/pricing (public page). This 6-tier model comes from Lindy's competitive analysis (Jan 2026). The discrepancy suggests CrewAI revised pricing or has different tiers for different markets.

### 4.4 OpenAI Agents SDK Update (April 15, 2026)

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Native sandbox execution | Controlled environments with files, tools, dependencies |
| Model-native harness | Codex-like filesystem tools (shell, apply-patch) |
| MCP integration | Full Model Context Protocol tool use |
| AGENTS.md | Custom instructions file (analogous to CEX's CLAUDE.md) |
| Progressive disclosure | Skills system for capability layering |
| Snapshotting | Durable state with rehydration |
| Guardrails | Prompt-injection and exfiltration prevention |

**CEX angle:** OpenAI SDK's AGENTS.md + skills + MCP mirrors what CEX already has (CLAUDE.md + skills + MCP gateway). The difference: CEX has 125 typed kinds, 12 pillars, and 8F pipeline. OpenAI SDK is a bare harness -- powerful but unstructured.


| Component | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Memory model | Three-layer: keyword indexing (SQLite FTS5) + user profile + task history |
| Skill system | Self-created Markdown files from task outcomes; agent decides retain/discard |
| LLM support | 200+ models via OpenRouter, Nous Portal, NVIDIA NIM, OpenAI, custom |
| Messaging | 6 integrations: Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, CLI |
| Key capability | 40% reduction in research-task time via accumulated skills |
| Architecture | Python-first, decoupled running/communication, isolated subagent spawning |


|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Knowledge persistence | Markdown skills (untyped) | 125 typed kinds x 12 pillars |
| Memory model | SQLite FTS5 keyword search | TF-IDF + LLM reranking + entity memory |
| Quality gates | None (self-assessed) | 8F pipeline + H01-H07 + cex_score.py |
| Multi-runtime | Single (Python + OpenRouter) | 4 runtimes (Claude/Codex/Gemini/Ollama) |
| Self-improvement | Skill documents (retain/discard) | cex_evolve.py + learning_records + regression_checks |
| Governance | None | GDP + decision manifests + audit trail |
| Orchestration | Single agent + subagent spawn | 8-nucleus grid dispatch + composable crews |
| Security | Skill poisoning risk | Governed artifact pipeline |

## 5. Market Intelligence

### 5.1 Market Size (multiple sources, cross-verified)

| Source | 2025 Value | 2030 Projection | CAGR |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|------|
| Spec (seed_intel_crm) | -- | $52.63B | 46.3% |
| Substack (Jozefiak, Feb 2026) | $7.84B | $52.6B | 46% |
| Awesome AI Agents 2026 | -- | $52.63B | 46.3% |
| LangChain State of AI Agents | 57% of orgs have agents in production | -- | -- |

**Consensus:** ~$8B (2025) -> ~$53B (2030) at 46% CAGR. Numbers are consistent across sources.

### 5.2 Framework Rankings (AliceLabs, April 15, 2026)

| Rank | Framework | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | LangGraph | Stateful production workflows with HITL |
| 2 | CrewAI | Fast multi-agent prototypes (role-based) |
| 3 | AutoGen/AG2 | Research-style agent conversations |
| 4 | Semantic Kernel | Enterprise.NET stacks |
| 5 | LlamaIndex | Data-grounded RAG agents |
| 6 | Pydantic AI | Type-safe Python development |


**CEX positioning gap:** No framework in this ranking offers typed knowledge infrastructure + multi-runtime + governance pipeline. CEX occupies unclaimed territory between "framework" (what these are) and "AI brain" (what CEX aspires to be).

### 5.3 Ecosystem Scale (Substack, Feb 2026)

| Metric | Framework | Value |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Monthly PyPI downloads | LangChain | 187M |
| Integrations | LangChain | 700+ |
| GitHub stars (legacy) | AutoGPT | 182K |
| ClawHub skills | OpenClaw | 13,729+ |
| Certified developers | CrewAI | 100,000+ |
| LLM providers supported | OpenAI Agents SDK | 100+ |

---

## 6. Competitive Threat Matrix (N01 Assessment)

| Framework | Threat to CEX | Why | Action |
|-----------|---------------|-----|--------|
| CrewAI | HIGH | Dominant in enterprise (60% F500). Brazilian founder = BR seeding collision. | Differentiate on typed infrastructure vs role-crew abstraction. Acknowledge Joao Moura's success. |
| OpenClaw | MEDIUM | Massive stars but security liability. Different category (gateway vs brain). | Position as "the governed alternative for enterprises burned by OpenClaw CVEs" |
| LangChain/LangGraph | MEDIUM | Largest ecosystem (187M downloads). Production-grade. | Don't compete on ecosystem size. Compete on knowledge compounding and multi-runtime. |
| OpenAI Agents SDK | MEDIUM | Official SDK from the gorilla. AGENTS.md mirrors CEX patterns. | Position CEX as "what OpenAI SDK becomes when you add typed knowledge and sovereignty" |
| Pydantic AI | LOW-MEDIUM | Type-safe angle overlaps with CEX's typed approach. Growing fast. | Acknowledge shared values (type safety). Differentiate on scope (Pydantic AI = single agent; CEX = 8-nucleus system) |
| LlamaIndex | LOW | RAG-focused, not multi-agent orchestration. | Complementary, not competitive. CEX can use LlamaIndex as a retrieval backend. |
| AutoGen | LOW | Dormant. Successor (MAF) is the real competitor. | Ignore AutoGen. Monitor Microsoft Agent Framework instead. |
| MetaGPT | NEGLIGIBLE | Abandoned (13 months without release). | Remove from active competitor tracking. |
| Agency Swarm | LOW | Small (4K stars, 24 contributors). Lightweight niche. | Irrelevant for enterprise positioning. |

---

|-----------|-------------------------|
| OpenClaw: 335K+ stars | 363,418 (+8.5%) |
| AutoGen: ~30K stars | 57,403 -- but DORMANT (2 commits/30d) |
| MetaGPT: ~40K stars | 67,390 -- but DORMANT (0 commits/30d, no release in 13mo) |
| LlamaIndex: ~35K stars | 48,891 |
| Pydantic AI: ~10K stars | 16,604 |
| OpenAI Agents SDK: "N/A" stars | 24,981 |
| CrewAI total executions: 1.4B | 2B+ (updated March 2026) |
| CrewAI pricing: 2 tiers | 6 tiers ($0 to Ultra) per Lindy competitive analysis |
