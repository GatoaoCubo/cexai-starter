# N01 Embedder Provider

## Purpose
The embedder provider is the lens that turns text into retrievable geometry.
For N01, that geometry must preserve competitor closeness and technical nuance without collapsing distinct claims into vague semantic sameness.
Analytical Envy means embedding quality is judged by whether it helps find the strongest comparative evidence first.

## Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Kind | `embedder_provider` |
| Pillar | `P01` |
| Nucleus | `N01` |
| Lens | `Analytical Envy` |
| Primary workload | research corpora, product pages, docs, converted papers |
| Selection priority | retrieval quality, cost, update speed, interoperability |
| Default family | cloud API with local fallback |
| Dense retrieval role | candidate generation for comparative synthesis |
| Coupled artifacts | chunk strategy, vector store, retriever config |
| Main risk | mixing models or dimensions across one corpus |

## Provider Thesis
N01 does not need the most famous embedding model.
N01 needs the provider that best separates:
- official docs from commentary
- similar competitors with materially different positioning
- technical synonyms from actual product parity
- stable definitions from transient marketing language

## Selection Criteria

| Criterion | Why N01 cares |
|-----------|----------------|
| semantic precision | avoids false equivalence between rivals |
| multilingual tolerance | market research and regional signals may mix languages |
| dimension control | index cost and latency tuning |
| throughput | bulk refresh of changing market data |
| pricing | recurring research budgets matter |
| operational maturity | fewer hidden integration costs |
| local fallback | resilience when external APIs fail |

## Recommended Provider Stack

| Role | Choice pattern | Reason |
|------|----------------|--------|
| primary cloud | modern high-value API model | best quality for live corpora |
| local fallback | sentence-transformer or equivalent local model | continuity during API outage |
| evaluation baseline | frozen reference model | compare drift after provider changes |

N01 should prefer one primary model family per active index.
Mixing providers inside the same collection destroys score interpretability.

## Embedding Rules
1. Embed chunks, not whole reports.
2. Use the same model for indexing and query vectors.
3. Normalize vectors if the backend expects cosine behavior.
4. Reindex after dimension or model changes.
5. Keep the provider metadata on every indexed document.

## Comparative Failure Cases

| Failure | Impact on N01 |
|---------|---------------|
| overly generic embeddings | competitors with different products cluster too tightly |
| weak domain sensitivity | technical method cards become hard to retrieve |
| dimension mismatch | vector store corruption or silent retrieval drift |
| mixed-model index | scores lose meaning across rows |
| stale baseline | cannot tell if provider swap improved or harmed retrieval |

## Evaluation Questions
N01 should test providers with adversarial query sets, not only happy-path semantic lookups.

| Query type | Why it matters |
|------------|----------------|
| exact competitor-vs-competitor comparisons | core battle card workload |
| pricing and packaging queries | dates and qualifiers matter |
| method and benchmark queries | technical nuance matters |
| contradictory source queries | conflict retrieval matters |
| entity plus region queries | scope must survive semantic compression |

## Operational Metadata

| Metadata field | Use |
|----------------|-----|
| provider_name | audit and reproducibility |
| model_name | retrieval traceability |
| dimensions | compatibility with store |
| normalization | scoring consistency |
| indexed_at | freshness and reindex planning |
| batch_policy | throughput diagnostics |

## Cost Discipline
Analytical Envy is ambitious but not careless.
Choose a provider that can support:
- routine re-embedding of volatile sources
- evaluation snapshots
- fallback during rate limits
- cost visibility per corpus refresh

Cheap but inaccurate embeddings cost more when they force weak synthesis.
Expensive but marginally better embeddings are wasteful if the corpus is small and well-structured.
N01 should optimize for evidence retrieval quality per refresh dollar.

## Integration With N01 Stack
The embedder provider should feed:
- comparison-preserving chunk strategy
- hybrid retriever candidate generation
- vector backend dimension contract
- citation-linked metadata filters

It should not own reranking, source reliability, or synthesis logic.

## Anti-Patterns
- treating embedding benchmarks as universal truth without corpus tests
- selecting a model only by price
- ignoring multilingual or domain-specific retrieval behavior
- comparing providers using different chunk strategies
- changing provider without re-running retrieval evaluations

## N01 Decision
The N01 embedder provider is selected by comparative retrieval performance, not brand prestige.
If it cannot retrieve the strongest opposing evidence and the most relevant rival context, it is the wrong provider no matter how cheap or popular it is.

### How to use

```text
ROLE: You configure the N01 retriever's embedding layer.
ACT:
  - Pick the embedder whose dimension/cost row fits the corpus size + latency budget.
  - Keep the embedder consistent between index build and query time.
  - Re-embed when switching models; never mix vector spaces.
OUTPUT: an embedder choice the vector store and retriever can both use.
```
