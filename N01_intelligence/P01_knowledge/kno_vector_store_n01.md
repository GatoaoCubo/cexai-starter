# N01 Vector Store

## Purpose
The vector store is where N01 preserves semantic access to evidence at scale.
Analytical Envy means the store is judged by how well it keeps high-value differences retrievable under pressure.
A fast store that blurs source quality or axis boundaries is strategically weak.

## Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Kind | `vector_store` |
| Pillar | `P01` |
| Nucleus | `N01` |
| Lens | `Analytical Envy` |
| Main role | dense candidate retrieval |
| Primary requirement | metadata-rich filtering |
| Preferred topology | separate namespaces by corpus intent |
| Distance metric | cosine on normalized vectors |
| Index policy | exact or ANN chosen by scale and latency |
| Main hazard | mixed dimensions and mixed semantics in one collection |

## Store Thesis
N01 does not need a vector database.
N01 needs a backend that can preserve retrieval meaning across:
- competitor knowledge
- citation-rich source notes
- research memories
- ontology fragments
- benchmark artifacts

The storage design must support both semantic similarity and strict metadata segmentation.

## Namespace Strategy

| Namespace | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| `research_notes` | synthesized evidence chunks |
| `citations` | source-grounded excerpt chunks |
| `competitors` | vendor and product comparison material |
| `papers` | technical method and benchmark content |
| `memory` | entity and summary fragments when vectorized |

This prevents low-value or mismatched content from crowding high-value research queries.

## Required Capabilities

| Capability | Why N01 needs it |
|------------|------------------|
| metadata filtering | constrain by source tier, date, axis, region |
| collection isolation | separate volatile and stable corpora |
| dimension enforcement | protect retrieval integrity |
| upsert efficiency | frequent source refreshes |
| deletion or reindex support | volatile markets require replacement |
| score visibility | debugging and evaluation |

## Backend Selection Logic

| Context | Good fit |
|---------|----------|
| local experimentation | FAISS or Chroma |
| production with existing Postgres footprint | pgvector |
| managed scale and low ops burden | Pinecone or Qdrant Cloud |
| self-hosted control with strong filtering | Qdrant |

N01 should choose the simplest backend that still supports metadata-heavy comparative retrieval.

## Storage Rules
1. One collection should map to one embedding dimension contract.
2. Store citation identifiers and reliability metadata with every vector.
3. Keep entity and axis metadata first-class, not buried in text.
4. Version the embedding model on the collection.
5. Rebuild indexes after major chunk strategy changes.

## Comparative Retrieval Support

| Need | Store implication |
|------|-------------------|
| direct vendor-vs-vendor lookup | entity pair metadata support |
| pricing research | freshness and region filters |
| benchmark retrieval | metric and unit metadata |
| contradiction analysis | conflict tagging support |
| memory reuse | source artifact lineage |

## Operational Risks
- vectors from multiple models in one namespace
- citation metadata missing on upsert
- no lifecycle for stale pricing content
- too much unrelated content in one collection
- score inspection impossible during evaluation

## N01 Store Policy
Prefer a backend that lets retrieval be explained.
That usually means:
- readable metadata
- inspectable scores
- predictable filtering behavior
- clean reindex workflows

Opaque convenience becomes expensive when a competitive claim must be defended.

## Minimal Collection Schema

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| doc_id | `cmp_openai_pricing_2026q2_03` |
| embedding_model | `text-embedding-3-small` |
| chunk_strategy | `comparison_recursive_900` |
| source_id | `cit_openai_pricing_2026q2` |
| entity_primary | `OpenAI` |
| comparison_axis | `pricing` |
| date_claim | `2026-04-16` |
| reliability_tier | `tier_2` |
| region | `global` |

## N01 Decision
The vector store is only valuable when it helps N01 retrieve the right opposing evidence at the right time.
Storage without comparative structure is just a fast place to keep future confusion.

### How to use

```text
ROLE: You configure the N01 retriever's vector backend.
ACT:
  - Choose the backend + index whose scale/recall row fits the corpus.
  - Match the index dimension to the chosen embedder.
  - Tune recall vs latency via the index parameters, not by switching stores midway.
OUTPUT: a vector-store config the retriever can build and query.
```
