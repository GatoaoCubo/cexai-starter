## Purpose

Formal ontology of the CEX typed knowledge system. Defines classes, properties, and relationships
in a machine-readable structure. Maps CEX-native terms to OWL/RDF and industry-standard equivalents.

Audience: LLM-to-LLM communication, cross-nucleus vocabulary enforcement, external system integration.

## Axioms

### Covering Axiom
Every Kind instance belongs to exactly one Pillar:
```
Kind subClassOf (belongsToPillar exactly 1 Pillar)
```

### Domain Routing Axiom
Every Kind instance routes to at least one Nucleus:
```
Kind subClassOf (routesToNucleus min 1 Nucleus)
```

### Quality Floor Axiom
Published Kind instances (non-null quality) must satisfy the 8.0 floor:
```
KindInstance and (hasQuality some xsd:float) -> hasQuality >= 8.0
```

### 8F Completeness Axiom
Every Kind class maps to exactly one LLMFunction:
```
Kind subClassOf (governedBy exactly 1 LLMFunction)
```

### Builder Axiom
Every Kind class has exactly one Builder agent:
```
Kind subClassOf (hasBuilder exactly 1 Builder)
```

### How to use

```text
ROLE: You enforce ubiquitous language at F2b SPEAK.
ACT:
  - Resolve every concept to its canonical term here before emitting output.
  - Reject invented synonyms; map them to the canonical entry.
  - Use the relationships to keep cross-nucleus references consistent.
OUTPUT: artifacts written in the canonical CEX vocabulary.
```
