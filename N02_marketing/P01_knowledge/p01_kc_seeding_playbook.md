# Community Seeding Playbook: CEX Open-Source Launch

## 1. Executive Summary


---

## 2. Lessons from Competitors (Extracted from Case Studies)

| Competitor | What Worked | What Failed | Replicable for CEX? |
|------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **OpenClaw** (335K stars, 60 days) | "Replace $20/mo tools" economic framing; MIT license + self-hosting trust signal; multi-provider architecture positioning; ClawHub marketplace (13,729 skills) creating ecosystem lock-in | 20% of ClawHub skills contained malicious payloads -- no vetting infrastructure; press-dependent J-curve that plateaued without new catalysts | Economic framing: YES. Marketplace: YES (CEX kind registry). MIT: YES. Trademark drama: NO. Founder celebrity ($800M exit): NO |
| **CrewAI** (49.8K stars, 18 months) | Intuitive role/goal/backstory API -- any dev can demo in 15 min; social proof escalation ladder (4K -> "Fortune 500" -> "$18M" -> "100K certified"); certification program creating investment lock-in; 40% faster time-to-prototype claim | Enterprise claims require actual enterprise adoption first; $18M funding press cannot be manufactured | Easy-to-demo API: YES (CEX `/build`). Social proof ladder: YES (plan milestones ahead). Certification: YES (8F pipeline as curriculum). Funding press: NO |
| **LangChain** (124K stars, 24 months) | Andrew Ng / DeepLearning.AI course partnership -- institutional distribution to millions; 700+ integrations = 700 natural referral communities; founder personally responded to GitHub issues in first 6 months; weekly webinars as community heartbeat | Complex API required expert tutorials, limiting community content creation; over-reliance on one distribution deal (Andrew Ng) | Founder issue responses: YES. Weekly webinars: YES. Integration network: YES (slow). Institutional distribution deal: PARTIAL (requires relationship). Content complexity: AVOID |

### Key Replicable Patterns (Zero Budget Required)

| Pattern | Source | CEX Application |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Economic displacement framing | OpenClaw | "Replace 3-5 paid AI tools with one self-hosted brain" |
| "15-minute first demo" path | CrewAI | `/build landing_page` produces artifact in under 5 minutes |
| Social proof escalation ladder | CrewAI | Plan milestones: 100 stars -> 500 -> 1K -> 5K (each triggers press angle) |
| Founder issue response | LangChain | Respond to every GitHub issue within 4 hours for first 6 months |

### Non-Replicable Patterns (Do Not Plan For)

| Pattern | Why Not | Alternative |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Founder celebrity (OpenClaw's $800M exit) | Requires prior company exit | Build credibility through artifact quality, not biography |
| Trademark drama press cycle | Cannot manufacture involuntary events | Create your own press events via release cadence |
| $18M+ VC funding press wave | Funding-dependent | Substitute with production metrics ("X artifacts compiled by community") |
| Andrew Ng partnership | Relationship-dependent | Pitch smaller newsletters first (console.dev, TLDR.tech, Latent.Space) |

---

## 3. Anti-Patterns (CRITICAL -- What NOT to Do)

### Communities That Ban Self-Promotion

| Community | Rule | Consequence of Violation | Correct Approach |
|-----------|------|--------------------------|------------------|
| r/MachineLearning (3M members) | No promotional posts; self-promotion restricted to monthly thread | Post removed + temporary ban; repeat = permanent ban | Contribute technical comments for 2-4 weeks before posting; use monthly self-promotion thread only |
| r/LocalLLaMA (694K members) | No low-effort promotion; requires substantive technical content | Downvoted to oblivion + mod removal | Post benchmarks, architecture analysis, or comparison data -- not "check out my framework" |
| r/ClaudeAI (747K members) | No spam; community expects genuine Claude-related content | Post removed if perceived as advertising | Share CEX as a tool that enhances Claude usage, not as a standalone product pitch |
| Hacker News | No astroturfing (coordinated upvotes); no duplicate submissions | Shadowban on account + domain | ONE Show HN post per major release; respond to every comment; never ask friends to upvote |
| LangChain Discord (30K members) | No competitive framework promotion in #general | Message deleted + possible kick | Only mention CEX when directly answering a user's question about multi-agent orchestration |
| Data Hackers Slack (41K members, BR) | Community rules require relevant, non-spammy content | Kicked from workspace | Post in #show-e-tell or #ferramentas; provide genuine value, not sales pitch |
| MLOps Community Slack (27.9K members) | Professional tone; no product spam | Removed from channel | Contribute to discussions about ML governance, quality gating -- mention CEX only when directly relevant |

### Tactics That Backfire

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Real Example | What To Do Instead |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Cross-posting the same text to 10+ communities | Communities detect copy-paste; moderators coordinate across platforms | Generic "we launched X" posts on Reddit/Discord/HN simultaneously get flagged | Write platform-native content: Reddit gets technical depth, Twitter gets thread format, Discord gets conversation |
| "Star and share!" calls to action | Developer audiences react negatively to explicit star solicitation | Repos with "please star!" in README get mocked on r/programming | Let the product earn stars; CTA should be "try it" not "star it" |
| Bot-generated stars | 4.5M fake stars detected by GitHub (Socket Inc/CMU study, 2025); GitHub's fraud detection can suppress real discovery | Framework X gained 10K stars overnight; all from accounts with no avatar, no repos, no followers -- algorithmic suppression followed | Real stars compound: they fork, contribute, report issues, create tutorials |
| Posting without a polished README | Developers decide in 3 seconds whether to explore further | Repos with no demo GIF, no quick start, no value prop get 60%+ bounce rate | README must have: 1-sentence value prop, demo GIF, 3-line quick start, badge wall |
| Arguing with critics | Public arguments amplify negative coverage and signal insecurity | Framework maintainers defending against "why not just use LangChain" comments created viral negative threads | Acknowledge valid criticism, provide data, move on. "That's fair feedback -- here's what we optimize for differently:" |
| Claiming features you do not have yet | Developer communities verify claims within hours | Frameworks claiming "production-ready" with no test coverage get exposed on HN | Only claim what the repo demonstrates. "300 kinds" is verifiable. "Enterprise-ready" requires proof |
| Spamming WhatsApp/Telegram groups (BR) | BR communities are tight-knit; spam is identified instantly and gets you banned permanently | Automated messages to 20+ Telegram groups = blacklisted across the ecosystem | Engage in 3-5 groups organically for 2+ weeks before sharing anything CEX-related |

### The Credibility Window

Every community gives a new member approximately 3-5 interactions before judging them. This window determines whether you are seen as a contributor or a spammer.

| Interaction # | What To Do | What NOT To Do |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| 1-2 | Answer someone else's question; share a useful resource (not yours) | Post about your project |
| 3-4 | Engage in a discussion; offer technical insight | Drop a link to your repo |
| 5+ | Mention CEX naturally when it answers someone's specific question | "Check out CEX" as a standalone message |

## 6. Content Templates

### Twitter/X Thread Template

```
Tweet 1:
Every AI agent forgets.
CEX remembers.

I built a typed knowledge system where intelligence compounds.
300 artifact kinds. 8-function reasoning pipeline. 4 runtimes.

Here's what that means for you: [thread]

[Attach: 30-second demo GIF of /build command]

Tweet 2:
Most AI frameworks give you building blocks.
CEX gives you a factory.

You say: "build landing_page"
CEX loads:
- The landing-page builder (12 specialized ISOs)
- Your brand context
- Quality gates (9.0 minimum)
- Compiles to your git repo

5 words in. Production artifact out.

Tweet 3:
The architectural difference:

LangChain: untyped chains (code)
CrewAI: untyped roles (ad hoc)
OpenClaw: untyped skills (13K, 20% compromised)

CEX: 300 TYPED kinds x 12 pillars
Every artifact has: schema, quality score, compilation

Typed knowledge > untyped output.

Tweet 4:
Runs on:
- Claude (via Claude Code)
- Gemini
- Codex
- Ollama (fully local)

Your knowledge stays in YOUR repo.
No vendor lock-in. No telemetry dependency.
No $39/seat/month (looking at you, LangSmith).

Self-sovereign AI infrastructure.

Tweet 5:
MIT license. Self-hosted. Quality-governed.

"5 words in. Professional artifact out.
Intelligence compounds."

### Reddit Post Template (r/ClaudeAI)

```
Title: I built an AI brain on top of Claude Code -- 300 typed knowledge artifacts, quality gates, and multi-runtime dispatch

I've been building CEX for [time period] and wanted to share what I learned about
structuring AI output as typed, governed knowledge instead of disposable chat responses.

**The Problem**: Every AI framework produces untyped output. You prompt, you get text,
it evaporates. Next session starts from zero.

**What CEX Does Differently**:

1. **300 typed artifact kinds**: Every output has a kind ([[p01_kc_knowledge_card]], landing_page,
 [[p01_kc_agent]], workflow...), a pillar (P01-P12), and a schema. This means your AI output is
 searchable, compilable, and compounding.

2. **8F mandatory reasoning pipeline**: Every task passes through 8 functions --
 CONSTRAIN, BECOME, INJECT, REASON, CALL, PRODUCE, GOVERN, COLLABORATE. The pipeline
 is mandatory. No shortcuts.

3. **Quality gates** (p01_kc_quality_gate): Nothing ships below 8.0/10. F7 GOVERN runs 7 HARD gates and 5D
 scoring automatically.

4. **4 runtimes**: Claude, Gemini, Codex, Ollama. Your knowledge stays in your git repo
 regardless of which provider you use.

**Quick Start**:
```
/build landing_page
```
That's it. CEX loads the landing-page builder, injects your brand context, reasons
through 8F, produces the artifact, scores it, and compiles it into your repo.

**What I'm NOT claiming**: CEX is not a replacement for LangChain or CrewAI.
They're frameworks for building agent pipelines. CEX is a knowledge system --
it produces governed, typed artifacts that accumulate.

Happy to answer questions about the architecture. MIT license, self-hosted.

## 7. BR-Specific Strategy

Brazilian communities require a fundamentally different approach from global English-language channels. The platform mix, cultural norms, and communication style differ significantly.

### Platform Priority (BR)

| Platform | Why Dominant in BR | CEX Approach |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Telegram | 45% penetration; dominant for tech communities; groups are conversational and high-trust | Primary channel for organic seeding |
| WhatsApp | 97% smartphone penetration; Communities feature enables 5K-member groups | Bridge from Telegram groups (n8n Brasil has active WA link) |
| Discord | 252K in Rocketseat alone; younger dev audience; educational communities | Secondary channel; Rocketseat + Alura + AI Hub Brasil |
| Instagram | Not a dev platform but influencers cross-post here | Only for visual demos (Reels showing `/build` in action) |
| LinkedIn | Growing for tech content in BR; enterprise-facing | Enterprise positioning in Portuguese |

### BR Channel Priority (Ordered by Impact)

| # | Channel | Platform | Members | Approach | When |

### Cultural Norms for BR Communities

| Norm | Implication for CEX | Wrong Approach | Right Approach |
|------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Portuguese first | All BR community content must be in Portuguese; English posts are ignored or viewed as elitist | Posting the English README | Write a dedicated PT-BR blog post and community introduction |
| Personal relationships matter | BR communities trust people, not brands | "CEX is a typed knowledge system..." (corporate) | "Oi pessoal, eu construi uma ferramenta que..." (personal) |
| WhatsApp is for relationships | WA groups expect conversational, not broadcast-style posts | Dropping a link without context | Participating in conversations for days before sharing anything |
| "Jeitinho" (creative pragmatism) | BR developers value practical shortcuts over theoretical architecture | Leading with "300 kinds x 12 pillars x 8F pipeline" | Leading with "faz uma landing page com 5 palavras" |
| Community loyalty | Once you earn trust in a BR group, members actively promote you | Spreading thin across 20+ groups | Deep engagement in 5-7 groups |
| Influencer respect | BR tech influencers (Filipe Deschamps, Rocketseat founders) have outsized impact | Ignoring BR influencer ecosystem | Identify 3-5 BR AI influencers and build relationships |

### BR Content Templates (Portuguese)

**Telegram Introduction (n8n Brasil):**
```
Oi pessoal! Eu construi uma ferramenta open-source chamada CEX que complementa
n8n pra quem trabalha com IA.

A ideia: ao inves do output da IA sumir depois de cada conversa, CEX salva tudo
como artefatos tipados no seu repositorio git. Sao 300 tipos de artefato, cada
um com quality gate automatico.

Roda em Claude, Gemini, ou Ollama local. MIT license, self-hosted.

Nao quero spammar o grupo -- so achei que podia ser util pra quem aqui trabalha
com automacao + IA. Se alguem quiser, posso mostrar um demo rapido.

Repo: [link]
```

**LinkedIn Article Title (PT-BR):**
```
"Por que o output do seu agente de IA deveria ser tipado
(e o que acontece quando nao e)"
```

## 9. Risk Register

| # | Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Hacker News post gets zero traction | Medium | High | Pre-seed 50+ stars before posting; post at 12-17 UTC on Tue-Wed; have engaging comment responses ready. Fallback: resubmit with different angle after 2 weeks |
| 2 | Reddit posts flagged as self-promotion | Medium | Medium | Build 2-4 weeks of genuine participation history before posting; post in self-promotion threads where available; frame as experience sharing, not product launch |
| 3 | "300 kinds is overwhelming" first impression | High | High | README leads with "5 words in, professional artifact out" -- hide complexity behind simplicity. Show 3-5 most useful kinds, not all 300 |
| 4 | Critics compare star count to LangChain/CrewAI | High | Medium | Preempt: "We're pre-launch. Here's what we have that they don't: [typed knowledge, quality gates, multi-runtime]." Position production metrics over vanity metrics |
| 5 | No community tutorials emerge organically | Medium | High | Make CEX trivially demo-able (15-min first artifact path). Create 3 example tutorials yourself. Seed "Good First Issue" labels for contributor onboarding |
| 6 | BR community sees CEX as "gringo tool" | Low | Medium | All BR content in Portuguese. Lead with personal story. Engage in BR communities for 2+ weeks before any CEX mention. Leverage CrewAI's Joao Moura as proof of BR market appetite |
| 7 | Discord server is empty/inactive | Medium | Medium | Do not launch Discord until 50+ people are ready to join (from Reddit/HN/PH response). Seed with 10+ welcome conversations. Schedule weekly office hours from day 1 |
| 8 | Product Hunt launch falls flat | Medium | Medium | Prepare hunter relationship 2 weeks before launch. Have 10+ early supporters ready for launch day engagement. Prepare polished screenshots and demo video in advance |
| 9 | Competitor community bans CEX mentions | Low | Low | Never promote in competitor Discord/Slack channels. Only mention CEX when answering a specific user question. Build reputation first, mention product second |
| 10 | README/docs quality does not match positioning claims | Medium | Critical | Dogfood: use CEX to build CEX docs. Demo GIF must show REAL output, not mocked screenshots. Every claim in README must be verifiable by visiting the repo |
| 11 | Founder burnout from 12-week daily posting schedule | Medium | High | Batch-create content on weekends for the coming week. Automate social media scheduling. Recruit 1-2 community volunteers by Week 4 to share posting load |
| 12 | GitHub's fake star detection flags coordinated seed stars | Low | High | Never use bot accounts. Only ask real developers who genuinely try the tool. Seed stars should come from accounts with real commit history and followers |
