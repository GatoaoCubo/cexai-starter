## Explanation

N02's 8F pipeline transforms a marketing brief into seductive, testable ad copy.
These 4 examples calibrate easy (one platform, clear brief) through hard (multi-platform
retargeting with restricted vocabulary). Each output shows the exact structured form:
angles declared first, copy variants second, quality metadata last.

The sin lens is active on every example: output must make the reader WANT, not just KNOW.

### How to use

```text
ROLE: You are N02 producing paid ad copy; treat these 4 pairs as the pattern to imitate.
ACT:
- Take the input brief shape (audience, funnel_stage, offer, promise, proof, constraints) as required.
- Declare named angles BEFORE writing copy so variants are A/B-trackable.
- Emit angle + copy + cta + a quality_check block per variant; self-govern before delivery.
- Obey the Prompting Rules and avoid every row in Anti-Patterns.
```

## Example 1 (easy) -- LinkedIn B2B, MOFU, single platform

**Input brief**
```yaml
task: create_3_linkedin_ad_variants
audience: b2b_saas_founders
funnel_stage: mofu
offer: ai_agent_platform
promise: ship agents 10x faster than coding from scratch
proof:
  stat: "customers shipped first agent in under 2 hours"
  basis: "median across 47 beta customers"
constraints:
  max_chars: 240
  tone: direct_confident
  cta: start_free_trial
  banned: [hype_adjectives, passive_voice]
```

**8F trace (abbreviated)**
```
F1: kind=prompt_template/P03, pillar=P03, constraint=240 chars, tone=direct_confident
F2: N02 loaded. Creative Lust lens active -- desire before logic.
F3: kc_campaign (MOFU stage = differentiate+prove), brand_config, copy_analyzer
F4: angles -> pain_to_proof, aspiration, objection_break
F6: 3 variants, each = angle + copy + CTA
F7: proof present x3, CTA present x3, no hype, brand match = pass
```

**Output**
```yaml
variants:
  - angle: pain_to_proof
    copy: "Most agent builds stall at integration hell. Our customers bypass it. Median time to first live agent: under 2 hours. 47 teams confirmed it. Start your free trial."
    cta: "Start free trial"

  - angle: aspiration
    copy: "The best AI teams are not writing more code. They are composing agents from typed infrastructure. First one ships in hours. Start your free trial and see the gap."
    cta: "Start free trial"

  - angle: objection_break
    copy: "If you think agent development is weeks of plumbing, you are pricing the wrong stack. 47 teams shipped in under 2 hours each. Start your free trial before the next sprint."
    cta: "Start free trial"

  proof_present: true
  cta_count: 1 per variant
  hype_words: 0
  stage_alignment: mofu (differentiate + prove)

F3: kc_campaign (TOFU = educate, frame), brand_config, kc_visual_hierarchy_principles
F4: angles -> identity_mirror, proof_by_number
F6: 2 variants, warm_irreverent voice, emoji allowed
F7: hook in first line, no doom language, CTA present = pass
```

**Output**
```yaml
variants:
  - angle: identity_mirror
    copy: "Streetwear that does not cost the planet a favor. 12,000 orders shipped. All carbon-neutral. Link in bio."
    cta: "Link in bio"

```

**8F trace (abbreviated)**
```
F1: kind=prompt_template/P03, constraint=50 chars, test_hypothesis present
F2: N02. BOFU = remove risk, close. Email subject = first filter.
F3: kc_email_sequence (subject line patterns), campaign quality gate
F4: 3 hypothesis angles (urgency, curiosity, social_proof) + 2 hybrid
F6: 5 variants mapped to hypothesis angles
F7: no spam triggers, no ALL_CAPS, CTA implicit, < 50 chars x5 = pass

  cta: "Secure my seat"

## Format Lessons

| Lesson | What the model learns |
|--------|-----------------------|
| Declare angles before copy | Angle names make A/B testing trackable |
| Include quality_check block | Self-govern before delivery; surface failures early |
| Adapt per platform, not per angle | Brief defines desire; channel defines length + format |
| Legal constraints are copy constraints | Never omit banned/legal from the brief |
| Proof discipline | Every variant carries evidence -- never decoration |

## Prompting Rules Derived From These Examples

1. Every brief must include: audience, funnel_stage, offer, promise, proof, constraints.
2. Declare test_hypothesis when running A/B -- angles need names, not just copy.
3. Include platform-specific char limits explicitly; let the model adapt.
4. Legal constraints belong in the brief `banned` or `legal_note` field.
5. Output format: angle + copy + cta + quality_check per variant.
6. For multi-platform: one brief, per-channel adaptation section.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Failure |
|-------------|---------|
| No proof in brief | Copy inflates -> trust gap |
| No angle declared | Copy is not testable; cannot iterate |
| Single variant only | A/B testing is impossible |
| Char limits omitted | Copy goes over; platform truncates; CTA lost |
| Legal constraints undeclared | Compliance failure in publish stage |
