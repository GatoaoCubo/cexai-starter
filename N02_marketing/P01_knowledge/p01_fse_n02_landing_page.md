## Explanation

Landing page copy is the highest-leverage copy N02 produces.
One page, one decision, one CTA. Every word either advances the conversion or wastes the reader's attention.

These 3 examples teach N02 the section-by-section architecture:
hero (promise) -> proof (credibility) -> features (desire) -> objections (trust) -> CTA (action).

The sin lens is non-negotiable: the hero must make the reader feel the desire before reading the proof.

### How to use

```text
ROLE: You are N02 writing landing page copy; imitate these 3 worked pairs.
ACT:
- Take the brief shape (product, audience, promise, proof, cta, sections_required, tone) as required.
- Build hero = promise-as-outcome (not product description); proof bar = numbers only.
- Write objections as the exact fear, answered without dismissing it; keep the CTA singular.
- Emit a quality_check block; obey the Prompting Rules and avoid every Anti-Pattern.
```

## Example 1 (easy) -- SaaS tool, B2B, single CTA

**Input brief**
```yaml
task: write_landing_page_copy
product: ai_agent_orchestration_platform
audience: senior_engineers_and_technical_founders
promise: "orchestrate 7 AI agents from one typed system in under 10 minutes"
proof:
  customers: "40+ enterprise teams"
  stat: "3x faster agent deployment vs. custom code"

cta: start_free_trial
sections_required: [hero, proof_bar, features_3, objections_2, final_cta]
tone: precise_confident
```

**8F trace (abbreviated)**
```
F1: kind=landing_page/P05, audience=technical, tone=precise_confident
F2: N02 + landing-page-builder context. Hero = promise + desire, not description.
F3: kc_campaign (BOFU=remove risk, close), brand_config, component_template
F4: hero: promise-as-outcome, proof_bar: numbers only, features: typed tables, objections: invert fears
F6: structured section output per required section
F7: hero has outcome not description, proof in bar, CTA singular, testimonial cited
```

**Output**
```yaml
hero:

objections:
  - fear: "This will take months to set up"
    answer: "The 8F pipeline runs on your first intent. First artifact in under 5 minutes."

```

## Format Lessons

| Lesson | What the model learns |
|--------|-----------------------|
| Hero = promise as outcome | Not "introducing X" -- "your life after X" |
| Proof bar = numbers only | No adjectives in the proof bar; let the numbers speak |
| Objections are fears | Name the fear exactly; answer without dismissing |
| Legal notes are copy constraints | Stat basis placement is a copy decision, not a footnote |
| Scarcity must be real | Fake urgency destroys trust; real scarcity closes deals |

## Prompting Rules Derived From These Examples

1. Hero headline = transformation outcome, not product description.
2. Proof bar: 3 items maximum, numbers only, no adjectives.
3. Testimonials: named + specific result + timeline. Anonymous quotes are noise.
4. Objections section: write the exact fear first; do not minimize it.
5. Scarcity: confirm real before including; omit if manufactured.
6. Legal constraints: embed stat basis adjacent to the stat in the copy, not in footnotes.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Failure |
|-------------|---------|
| Hero describes the product | Reader does not care what it is; they care what it does to them |
| Proof buried below fold | Credibility must appear before desire fully forms |
| Unnamed testimonials | "Happy customer" = 0 trust transfer |
| Fake scarcity in copy | Audiences detect it; trust collapses |
| Legal disclaimer as footnote | Compliance violation AND trust signal ignored |
