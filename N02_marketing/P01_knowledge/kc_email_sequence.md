# KC: Email Sequence Strategy

## Core Mental Model

An email sequence is NOT a list of emails. It's a **persuasion arc** — each message is one beat in a story where the reader is the protagonist. The sequence succeeds when the reader *arrives at the CTA feeling it was their own idea.*

```
Cold → Curious → Trusting → Wanting → Acting → Advocating
  E1      E2        E3        E4       E5        E6+
```

Every sequence has **emotional momentum**. Break it, lose the reader forever.

## The 5 Canonical Arcs

### 1. Welcome Arc (trust-building)
```
E1: Deliver + set expectations     [Gratitude → Curiosity]
E2: Quick win (prove value fast)   [Curiosity → Trust]
E3: Origin story (humanize brand)  [Trust → Connection]
E4: Deep value (best free content) [Connection → Desire]
E5: Soft pitch (earned CTA)        [Desire → Action]
```
**Timing**: 0h → 24h → 72h → 120h → 168h (1 week total)
**Key rule**: Never pitch before E4. The reader hasn't earned enough value to be asked.

### 2. Launch Arc (urgency + desire)
```
E1: Teaser (curiosity gap)         [Curiosity]
E2: Behind-the-scenes (story)      [Connection]
E3: Social proof dump (results)    [Trust → Desire]
E4: Cart open (full pitch)         [Desire → Action]
E5: FAQ + objection handling       [Doubt → Confidence]
E6: Last chance (scarcity real)    [Urgency → Action]
```
**Timing**: -7d → -3d → -1d → D-Day → +24h → +48h (close)
**Key rule**: Scarcity must be REAL. Fake urgency destroys trust permanently.

### 3. Re-engagement Arc (win-back)
```
E1: "Did I do something wrong?"    [Guilt → Curiosity]
E2: Best-of value (no pitch)       [Curiosity → Remembered value]
E3: Goodbye + gift                 [Loss aversion → Action]
```
**Timing**: Day 0 → +3d → +7d (then suppress or unsubscribe)
**Key rule**: The subject line of E1 does 90% of the work. It must feel human, not automated.

### 4. Onboarding Arc (activation)
```
E1: Welcome + first action         [Excitement → Momentum]
E2: Feature spotlight #1           [Momentum → Competence]
E3: Feature spotlight #2           [Competence → Mastery]
E4: Community + support intro      [Mastery → Belonging]
E5: Success milestone celebration  [Belonging → Advocacy]
```
**Timing**: 0h → 24h → 48h → 96h → 168h
**Key rule**: Each email has ONE action. Multiple CTAs in onboarding = abandonment.

### 5. Nurture Arc (long-term relationship)
```
Weekly or biweekly cadence:
- 3 value emails : 1 pitch email (3:1 ratio minimum)
- Alternate between: insight, story, resource, curated
- Pitch emails use earned trust — never cold-pitch
```
**Timing**: Weekly (Tue/Thu 9-11am local) or biweekly
**Key rule**: The 3:1 ratio is sacred. Drop below it and unsubscribe rates spike within 2 cycles.

## Email Anatomy — Universal Structure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ FROM NAME  ← Brand or human name (test both)│
│ SUBJECT    ← 6-10 words, one idea only      │
│ PREVIEW    ← First 90 chars visible in inbox │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ HOOK       ← First sentence = survival line  │
│ BODY       ← 1 idea, 150-300 words          │
│ CTA        ← 1 action, specific benefit      │
│ P.S.       ← Second hook (40%+ read PS first)│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Subject Line Formulas (ranked by avg open rate)
| Formula | Example | Avg Open Lift |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Curiosity gap | "The word that killed our conversions" | +22% |
| Personal question | "Quick question about your [X]" | +19% |
| Number + benefit | "3 ways to double reply rate" | +15% |
| "Re:" fake reply | "Re: your request" | +25% (but burns trust) |
| Emoji + contrast | "🔥 Cold leads → warm pipeline" | +12% |
| Name + context | "[Name], saw your [X]" | +18% |

**Golden rule**: If the subject works without the body, the body is redundant. Subject = promise. Body = delivery.

## Psychological Triggers Per Position

| Position | Best Trigger | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| E1 (opener) | Reciprocity | You just gave them something; they feel obligated to engage |
| E2 (value) | Competence | Quick win makes them feel smart — they associate that with you |
| E3 (story) | Similarity | Your origin story mirrors their journey — emotional bonding |
| E4 (deep value) | Authority | Your best content positions you as the expert they trust |
| E5 (pitch) | Social proof | Others already bought/joined — reduces perceived risk |
| E6 (close) | Scarcity | Real deadline creates action; fake deadline creates churn |

## Timing Science

### Send Time Optimization
```yaml
b2c_optimal:
  day: [tuesday, thursday]
  time: "09:00-11:00 local"
  avoid: [monday_morning, friday_afternoon, weekends]

b2b_optimal:
  day: [tuesday, wednesday, thursday]
  time: "08:00-10:00 local"
  avoid: [monday, friday, lunch_hour]

ecommerce:
  day: [any]
  time: "evening 19:00-21:00 local"  # browsing time
  weekend: "10:00-12:00 local"       # impulse window
```

### Spacing Rules
| Arc Type | Min Gap | Max Gap | Why |
|----------|---------|---------|-----|
| Welcome | 24h | 48h | Momentum matters — too slow = forgotten |
| Launch | 12h | 48h | Urgency compressed — tighter = stronger |
| Re-engagement | 72h | 168h | Too frequent = annoying (they're already disengaged) |
| Nurture | 5d | 14d | Consistency > frequency for long-term |
| Onboarding | 24h | 72h | User is actively exploring — guide while warm |

## Segmentation Triggers

```yaml
behavioral_triggers:
  opened_but_no_click: send_alternative_cta
  clicked_but_no_convert: send_objection_handler
  no_open_3x: move_to_reengagement_arc
  purchased: move_to_onboarding_arc
  high_engagement: tag_as_warm_lead

property_triggers:
  signup_source: customize_welcome_arc_E1
  industry: swap_case_studies_in_E3
  company_size: adjust_pricing_in_E5
  job_title: adjust_vocabulary_level
```

## A/B Testing Priority Stack

| Priority | Test Element | Expected Impact | Min Sample |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| 1 | Subject line (V1 vs V2) | 15-30% open rate delta | 500 per variant |
| 2 | Send time (morning vs evening) | 5-15% open rate delta | 1000 per variant |
| 3 | CTA text (benefit vs action) | 10-25% CTR delta | 300 per variant |
| 4 | Email length (short vs long) | 5-10% CTR delta | 500 per variant |
| 5 | From name (brand vs personal) | 8-20% open rate delta | 500 per variant |
| 6 | P.S. presence (with vs without) | 3-8% CTR delta | 500 per variant |

**Rule**: Test ONE variable at a time. Multi-variable tests require 10x sample size.

## Metrics That Matter

| Metric | Good | Great | Red Flag |
|--------|------|-------|----------|
| Open rate | 20%+ | 35%+ | <15% (deliverability or subject problem) |
| Click rate | 2.5%+ | 5%+ | <1% (CTA or content problem) |
| Unsubscribe per email | <0.5% | <0.2% | >1% (frequency or relevance problem) |
| Spam complaint | <0.08% | <0.03% | >0.1% (domain reputation at risk) |
| Reply rate | 1%+ | 3%+ | 0% (too polished, not human enough) |
| Sequence completion | 60%+ | 80%+ | <40% (spacing or relevance problem) |
