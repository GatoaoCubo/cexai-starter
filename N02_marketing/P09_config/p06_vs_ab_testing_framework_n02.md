# A/B Testing Framework — Marketing Copy

## 1. Testing Strategy & Design

### Test Categories by Impact
```yaml
high_impact_tests:
  - headline: "Primary value proposition statement"
  - cta_button: "Call-to-action text and design"
  - hero_copy: "Above-the-fold messaging"
  - email_subject: "Subject line variations"
  - offer_positioning: "How benefits are presented"
  
medium_impact_tests:
  - social_proof: "Testimonials vs stats vs logos"
  - urgency_elements: "Scarcity vs time-limited vs none"
  - copy_length: "Long-form vs short-form"
  - personalization: "Dynamic vs static content"
  - visual_hierarchy: "Copy layout and emphasis"
  
low_impact_tests:
  - button_color: "CTA button styling"
  - font_choice: "Typography variations"
  - image_placement: "Visual element positioning"
  - footer_copy: "Supporting information"
  - micro_copy: "Form labels and helper text"
```

### Test Design Framework
```yaml
test_structure:
  hypothesis: 
    format: "If we [CHANGE], then [METRIC] will [DIRECTION] because [REASONING]"
    example: "If we change headline from feature-focused to benefit-focused, then conversion rate will increase because prospects care more about outcomes than capabilities"
    
  variables:
    independent: "Element being tested (headline, CTA, etc.)"
    dependent: "Metric being measured (CTR, CVR, etc.)"
    controlled: "Everything else remains identical"
    
  variants:
    control: "Current/original version"
    treatment: "New version being tested"
    max_variants: 3  # Avoid multi-variant complexity
```

## 2. Statistical Requirements

### Sample Size Calculations
```yaml
statistical_power:
  confidence_level: 95%  # Standard for marketing tests
  statistical_power: 80%  # Probability of detecting true effect
  minimum_effect_size: 10%  # Smallest improvement worth detecting
  
sample_size_minimums:
  email_tests:
    list_size_min: 1000
    opens_needed: 200  # For subject line tests
    clicks_needed: 50   # For CTA tests
    
  landing_page_tests:
    visitors_min: 1000
    conversions_needed: 50  # For meaningful results
    
  ad_tests:
    impressions_min: 10000
    clicks_needed: 100
    conversions_needed: 20
```

### Test Duration Guidelines
```yaml
duration_requirements:
  minimum_duration: 7_days  # Account for weekly patterns
  maximum_duration: 30_days  # Avoid external factors
  
  factors_affecting_duration:
    traffic_volume: "Higher traffic = shorter duration needed"
    conversion_rate: "Higher CVR = faster statistical significance"
    effect_size: "Larger differences detected faster"
    day_of_week_patterns: "Must include full week cycles"
```

### Statistical Significance Validation
```yaml
significance_checks:
  primary_metric: 
    p_value_threshold: 0.05
    confidence_interval: 95%
    
  secondary_metrics:
    monitor_for: "Unexpected negative impacts"
    significance_level: 0.10  # More lenient for secondary
    
  stopping_rules:
    early_stop_positive: "99% confidence + business impact"
    early_stop_negative: "95% confidence + material harm"
    planned_analysis: "Weekly significance checks"
```

## 7. Quality Assurance & Best Practices

### Testing Hygiene Checklist
```yaml
pre_launch_qa:
  technical:
    - "Variants display correctly across devices"
    - "Tracking parameters firing properly"  
    - "Fallback behavior defined"
    
  statistical:
    - "Sample size calculations verified"
    - "Success metrics clearly defined"
    - "Baseline performance documented"
    
  business:
    - "Hypothesis clearly stated"
    - "Expected business impact estimated"
    - "Resource allocation confirmed"
```

### Common Testing Mistakes to Avoid
```yaml
statistical_errors:
  - "Peeking too early at results"
  - "Stopping test prematurely without significance"
  - "Running multiple tests simultaneously without correction"
  - "Confusing statistical vs practical significance"
  
design_errors:
  - "Testing too many variables simultaneously"
  - "Unequal traffic allocation without justification"
  - "Testing during atypical periods (holidays, launches)"
  - "Ignoring mobile vs desktop differences"
  
implementation_errors:
  - "Inconsistent user experience between variants"
  - "Technical issues affecting one variant more"
  - "External campaign interference"
  - "Insufficient documentation of test conditions"
```

This A/B testing framework ensures rigorous, statistically sound optimization of marketing copy while building institutional knowledge for compound improvement over time.
