## Overview
Instantiate when N02 needs to produce a coordinated content package across
social, email, and blog channels for a defined audience. The crew runs three
roles in strict sequence: strategist defines audience segments and messaging
angles, creator produces channel-specific content templates grounded on the
strategy brief, reviewer gates brand voice consistency and CTA effectiveness.
Producer is N02 (marketing); consumers are content ops, growth, and social teams.

This is a second flagship example of the **composable-crew** pattern, alongside
`product_launch`: `crew_template` (this file) + `role_assignment` (3 files) +
`team_charter` (1 instance-specific contract). Use `content_campaign` when the
deliverable is a RECURRING multi-channel content package rather than a one-time
launch event -- see `p12_ct_product_launch.md` for the launch-specific crew.

## Roles
| Role | Role Assignment ID | Reason |
|------|---------------------|--------|
| strategist | p02_ra_campaign_strategist.md | Define audience segments, channels, and messaging angles |
| creator | p02_ra_content_creator.md | Produce content templates for social, email, and blog |
| reviewer | p02_ra_content_reviewer.md | Score brand voice, CTA effectiveness; enforce quality gate |

## Process
Topology: `sequential`. Rationale: creator requires a validated strategy brief
before writing templates (no brief = no audience grounding); reviewer requires
all templates before scoring consistency across channels. Parallelism would
allow creator to start without segments, introducing misalignment risk.

## Memory Scope
| Role | Scope | Retention |
|------|-------|-----------|
| strategist | shared | persistent (strategy brief saved to P01) |
| creator | shared | per-crew-instance |
| reviewer | shared | per-crew-instance + regression_check archive |

## Handoff Protocol
`a2a-task-sequential` -- each role writes a completion signal with
`artifact_path` + `quality_score`. Next role reads prior artifact before
starting its own F1 CONSTRAIN. Creator reads `strategy_brief_id` from
strategist signal; reviewer reads `template_pack_id` from creator signal.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 3 role deliverables exist under `.cex/runtime/crews/{instance_id}/`
- [ ] strategy_brief contains >= 2 audience segments with channel mapping
- [ ] template_pack covers all 3 channels: social, email, blog
- [ ] reviewer quality_score >= 9.0 for brand voice + CTA dimensions
- [ ] Handoff protocol signals present for 3/3 roles

## Instantiation
```bash
python _tools/cex_crew.py run content_campaign \
    --charter N02_marketing/P12_orchestration/crews/team_charter_content_campaign_template.md
```

Copy `team_charter_content_campaign_template.md` to a mission-specific charter
first and fill its `{{open_vars}}` (campaign name, channels, deadline, budget)
-- never run the crew against the bare template.
