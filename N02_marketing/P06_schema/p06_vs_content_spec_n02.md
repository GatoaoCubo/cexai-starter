# Content Format Validation Schema

## Purpose

Every piece of copy generated for a campaign MUST pass this schema before
leaving the pipeline. Character limits are not suggestions. Tone rules are
not preferences. They are gates. Bad copy that ships is worse than no copy
at all.

## Platform Character Limits

| Platform | Asset Type | Headline | Body | CTA | Hashtags |
|----------|-----------|---------|------|-----|---------|
| Instagram | Post | 125 (above fold) | 2200 max | N/A | 30 max |
| Instagram | Story | N/A | 250 max | 25 (button label) | 10 |
| Instagram | Reel | 150 | 2200 | N/A | 30 |
| LinkedIn | Post | 150 | 3000 | N/A | 5 recommended |
| LinkedIn | Ad | 150 | 600 | 25 | N/A |
| X (Twitter) | Post | N/A | 280 | N/A | 2 recommended |
| Meta Ads | Headline | 40 | 125 | 25 | N/A |
| Email | Subject | 50 (40 mobile) | unlimited | 45 (button) | N/A |
| TikTok | Caption | N/A | 2200 | N/A | 30 max |
| YouTube | Title | 100 (70 visible) | unlimited | N/A | 15 max |

## Tone Rule Matrix

| Brand Voice | Allowed Patterns | Blocked Patterns |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `bold` | Direct imperatives, strong verbs, short punchy sentences | Passive constructions, qualifiers ("might", "could"), apologies |
| `conversational` | First-person plural, questions, contractions | Jargon, corporate-speak, passive voice |
| `professional` | Third-person or formal second, credentials, data citations | Slang, emoji overuse, exclamation marks |
| `playful` | Wordplay, alliteration, pop culture refs, emoji | Dry statistics, legal disclaimers as primary content |
| `authoritative` | Definitive statements, industry statistics, expert quotes | Hedging, uncertainty language, "we believe" |
| `empathetic` | Validation language, pain-point mirroring, second person warm | Prescriptive commands, statistics without context |

## CTA Requirements

```yaml
cta_rules:
  required_when:
    - campaign_goal: [conversion, consideration]

    - max_words: 5
    - no_passive: true
    - urgency_alignment: true        # if urgency_trigger=deadline -> CTA includes time signal
  forbidden_ctas:
    - "Click here"
    - "Learn more" (standalone, no context)
    - "Submit"

## Validation Output Schema

```yaml
validation_result:
  passed: boolean
  score: float (0.0-1.0)
  violations:
    - field: string
      rule: string
      severity: error|warning
      detail: string
      suggestion: string
  platform_compliance:

```

## Downstream Consumers

- `p03_ap_copy_generation_n02.md` -- reads the platform limit table + CTA rules at generation time
- `self_improvement_loop_n02.md` -- uses violation patterns as a learning signal
