# Audience Satisfaction NPS Survey

## Purpose

CTR and CVR measure what audiences DO. NPS measures what they FEEL.
Both signals are necessary. A high-CTR campaign that destroys brand trust
is a net loss. NPS catches what performance metrics miss: the emotional
residue that either compounds loyalty or accelerates churn.

## Core NPS Question

> "How likely are you to recommend [Brand/Product/Content] to a colleague or friend?"
> Scale: 0 (not at all likely) to 10 (extremely likely)

**Scoring:**
- **Promoters (9-10)**: Loyal, will amplify brand
- **Passives (7-8)**: Satisfied but switchable
- **Detractors (0-6)**: At risk, potentially vocal

**Formula:** NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors
**Target:** >= 40 (good), >= 60 (excellent), >= 70 (world-class)

## Survey Configuration Schema

```yaml
nps_survey:
  id: "nps_{campaign_id}_{wave}"
  trigger:
    type: post_purchase|post_content|post_campaign|periodic|behavioral
    delay_after_trigger_hours: 24    # minimum respect window
    max_surveys_per_user_per_month: 1
  channel: email|in_app|sms|linkedin_message
  language: string

  questions:
    primary:
      text: "How likely are you to recommend [brand] to a colleague?"
      type: nps_scale_0_10
    follow_up_promoter:
      condition: score >= 9
      text: "What made you give us that score? What do you value most?"
      type: open_text
      max_chars: 500
    follow_up_passive:
      condition: score in [7,8]
      text: "What would make you an even bigger fan?"

## Industry Benchmarks

| Category | NPS Benchmark |
|---------|--------------|
| B2B SaaS | 30-40 |
| Marketing Agency | 25-35 |
| Content Media | 35-50 |
| E-commerce | 45-60 |
| Enterprise Software | 20-30 |

## Copy Implications from NPS Data

| NPS Signal | Copy Action |
|-----------|------------|
| Promoter theme: "saves time" | Lead all TOFU with time-savings hook |
| Detractor theme: "too promotional" | Reduce direct-response frequency; increase value content |
| Passive theme: "good but generic" | Personalization lift: segment-specific copy |
| Score drop post-campaign | Campaign fatigue signal: reduce frequency or refresh creative |
| High NPS low CVR | Trust is there; friction is somewhere else -- test CTA and landing page |

## Closed-Loop Actions

```yaml
auto_actions:
  detractor:
    if score <= 4:
      trigger: customer_success_alert         # human review
    if score in [5,6]:
      trigger: retention_sequence_email        # automated nurture
  promoter:
    if score >= 9:
      trigger: referral_ask_sequence           # harvesting advocacy
    if score >= 10:
      trigger: testimonial_request_email       # social proof capture
```
