# Collaboration: invariant-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "what operational rule MUST always be followed?"
I formalize inviolable mandates with enforcement mechanisms and exception protocols. I do NOT produce flexible guides (instruction-builder), safety restrictions (guardrail-builder), or abstract truths (axiom-builder).
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Governance Pipeline"
```
  1. pattern-builder      -> "proven reusable solution to ground the mandate"
  2. invariant-builder          -> "elevates the pattern to an inviolable operational rule"
  3. quality-gate-builder -> "compliance gate that enforces the invariant at validation time"
```
### Crew: "Architecture Governance"
```
  1. agent-card-builder -> "defines what a agent_group component can do"
  2. invariant-builder            -> "defines what it MUST do — inviolable behavioral mandates"
  3. guardrail-builder      -> "adds runtime safety boundaries that complement the law"
```
### Crew: "Full Governance Package"
```
  1. axiom-builder         -> "establishes abstract truths that give laws their authority"
  2. invariant-builder           -> "codifies operational mandate derived from the axiom"
  3. diagram-builder       -> "visualizes law enforcement flow for the domain"
  4. component-map-builder -> "inventories all components governed by the law"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: rule statement to formalize, rationale, domain context (quality/security/ops), enforcement scope
- optional: precedent patterns, known exceptions, related instructions to differentiate from
### I Produce
- invariant artifact (Markdown, 19+ frontmatter fields, all 8 body sections, max 4KB)
- committed to: `cex/P08_architecture/examples/p08_law_{number}.md`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons
## Builders I Depend On
- pattern-builder: proven patterns may be elevated to mandatory laws; provides precedent and rationale
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| quality-gate-builder | gates encode law compliance as HARD validation conditions |
| guardrail-builder | translates operational laws into enforceable runtime safety restrictions |
| agent-card-builder | specs reference applicable laws governing each agent_group |
| diagram-builder | may visualize law enforcement flows for the governed domain |
| component-map-builder | maps reference which laws govern each component |
| instruction-builder | references laws to clarify what is mandatory vs flexible guidance |
