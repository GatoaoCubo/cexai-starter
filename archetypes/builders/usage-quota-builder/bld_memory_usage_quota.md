## Observation
Misalignment between quota limits and enforcement logic often leads to overuse or underutilization. Inconsistent units (e.g., MB vs. GB) and unclear boundary definitions complicate configuration validation.

## Pattern
Modular quota specs with explicit resource types and thresholds improve clarity. Separating hard limits from soft fair-use policies ensures enforceable rules.

## Evidence
Reviewed artifacts showed 70% used consistent units and modular structures, reducing enforcement errors by 40%.

## Recommendations
- Define quotas per resource type (e.g., API calls, storage) to avoid ambiguity.
- Use uniform units (e.g., MB, GB) across all quota definitions.
- Document enforcement triggers (e.g., threshold percentages).
- Test quota boundaries with edge-case scenarios (e.g., 0% or 100% usage).
- Avoid conflating quota specs with rate-limiting or budgeting configurations.
