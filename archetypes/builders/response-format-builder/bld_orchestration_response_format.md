# Collaboration: response-format-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "how should the LLM structure its output for this task?"
I design the format the LLM sees during generation. I do not validate output after generation, extract data from it, or transform it between formats.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Structured Output Pipeline"
```
  1. response-format-builder    -> "format spec injected into the prompt (LLM sees this during generation)"
  2. validation-schema-builder  -> "JSON/YAML schema applied post-generation to verify structure"
  3. parser-builder             -> "extractor that pulls fields from the validated output"
```
### Crew: "Agent Prompt Stack"
```
  1. system-prompt-builder      -> "agent identity and fixed instructions"
  2. prompt-template-builder    -> "parameterized template with {{variables}}"
  3. response-format-builder    -> "output structure injected at system_prompt or user_message"
```
### Crew: "Eval-Ready Agent Pack"
```
  1. response-format-builder    -> "canonical output structure the agent must produce"
  2. quality-gate-builder       -> "gates that check the format for completeness and correctness"
  3. golden-test-builder        -> "golden examples of correctly formatted responses"
  4. unit-eval-builder          -> "unit evaluations asserting format compliance"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: task type, desired format_type (json/yaml/markdown/csv/plaintext), required fields, injection_point
- optional: existing system prompt to inject into, example outputs, validation schema reference
### I Produce
- response_format artifact (YAML frontmatter 19 fields + format body with sections/fields/examples, max 4096 bytes)
- committed to: `cex/P05/examples/p05_rf_{name}.md`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons
## Builders I Depend On
- system-prompt-builder: provides the injection target when injection_point is system_prompt
- prompt-template-builder: provides the template body where the format spec is inserted
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| validation-schema-builder | Derives its schema from the fields I specify in the format |
| parser-builder | Knows which fields to extract based on my format definition |
| golden-test-builder | Golden outputs must conform to the format I define |
| formatter-builder | Transforms between formats starting from the structure I establish |
