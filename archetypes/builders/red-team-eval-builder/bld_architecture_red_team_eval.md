## Component Inventory
| Name | Role | Owner | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| attack_type | Named adversarial category defining attack vector | red_team_eval | required |
| target | Agent, prompt, or pipeline under adversarial evaluation | red_team_eval | required |
| pass_criteria | Observable definition of safe behavior (pass/fail) | red_team_eval | required |
| attack_scenario | Test case: placeholder payload + expected response + OWASP ref | red_team_eval | required |
| framework_config | Eval framework setup (Promptfoo/Garak/DeepEval/Patronus) | red_team_eval | required |
| owasp_ref | OWASP LLM Top 10 identifier linking attack to taxonomy | red_team_eval | recommended |
| severity | Risk classification if attack succeeds (critical/high/medium/low) | red_team_eval | recommended |
| system_prompt | Prompt under test — consumed by target at test time | P03 | external |
| guardrail | Runtime enforcement boundary — blocks attacks post-deploy | P11 | external |
| agent | Runtime agent under test | P02 | consumer |
| eval_dataset | Dataset of adversarial inputs populating attack scenarios | P07 | external |
## Dependency Graph

eval_dataset     --produces--> attack_scenario
attack_type      --depends-->  attack_scenario
attack_scenario  --depends-->  pass_criteria
attack_scenario  --depends-->  owasp_ref
framework_config --depends-->  attack_scenario
agent            --depends-->  target
target           --produces--> pass_criteria (graded against)
guardrail        --follows-->  red_team_eval (deployed after eval passes)
```
## Boundary Table
| red_team_eval IS | red_team_eval IS NOT |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Adversarial safety testing BEFORE deployment | Runtime enforcement boundary (guardrail, P11) |
| Tests attack vulnerabilities with adversarial inputs | Functional end-to-end correctness test (e2e_eval) |
| Scoped to attack_types from approved adversarial enum | Isolated unit logic test (unit_eval) |
| Produces pass/fail per attack scenario with evidence | Quick sanity check (smoke_eval) |

## Layer Map
| Layer | Components | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| taxonomy | attack_type, owasp_ref | Classify and trace adversarial threat surface |
| specification | target, pass_criteria | Define what is tested and what safe looks like |
| scenarios | attack_scenario, eval_dataset | Concrete adversarial test cases |
| execution | framework_config, severity | Configure eval runner and prioritize risk |
| governance | guardrail | Post-eval runtime enforcement |
| consumers | agent, system_prompt | Runtime components exercised by the eval |
