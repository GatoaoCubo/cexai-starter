# Memory: smoke-eval-builder
## Summary
Smoke evals are fast sanity checks (under 30 seconds) that verify basic component functionality before deeper testing. The critical production lesson is strict timeout enforcement — a smoke eval that takes 60 seconds defeats its purpose as a fast-fail gate. The second lesson is critical path selection: smoke evals must test the minimum set of operations that, if broken, indicate the component is fundamentally non-functional. Testing non-critical paths wastes the tight time budget.
## Pattern
1. Enforce strict timeout: 30 seconds maximum, prefer under 10 seconds — fail fast is the entire point
2. Test only the critical path: the minimum operations that prove the component is alive and functional
3. Assertions must be binary: works or does not work — no partial scores in smoke testing
4. Health checks should verify connectivity, basic I/O, and core operation — not business logic
5. Run smoke evals before any deeper testing — smoke failure should skip all downstream test suites
6. Include clear failure messages that identify which critical path component failed
## Anti-Pattern
1. Smoke evals exceeding 30 seconds — defeats the fast-fail purpose, becomes a slow unit test
2. Testing non-critical features in smoke evals — wastes time budget on things that do not indicate fundamental breakage
3. Partial scoring or graded results — smoke evals are binary: pass (component works) or fail (component broken)
4. Smoke evals that require complex setup/teardown — setup time should not exceed test time
5. Confusing smoke_eval (P07, fast sanity) with unit_eval (P07, correctness testing) or benchmark (P07, performance measurement)
6. Missing failure diagnostics — smoke fails but nobody knows which component caused it
## Context
Smoke evals operate in the P07 evaluation layer as the fastest, first-line test. They gate all subsequent testing: if smoke fails, no unit tests, integration tests, or benchmarks run. In CI/CD pipelines, smoke evals are the first step after build, providing sub-30-second feedback on whether the build is even worth testing further.
## Impact
Strict 30-second timeout enforcement saved an average of 15 minutes per failed pipeline by skipping downstream tests early. Critical-path-only testing achieved 95% detection rate for fundamental breakages. Binary assertions eliminated confusion about whether a smoke result was a pass or a warning.
## Reproducibility
Reliable smoke eval production: (1) identify 3-5 critical path operations, (2) write binary assertions per operation, (3) enforce 30-second total timeout, (4) minimize setup requirements, (5) include failure diagnostic messages, (6) validate the eval actually runs under 30 seconds on target hardware.
