observation: "Batch configs without cost_cap_usd caused runaway spend when input files were larger than expected. Batch jobs missing completion_window documentation caused downstream systems to poll indefinitely or time out prematurely. Missing retry policy for partial failures caused entire batch results to be discarded when 1-2% of requests failed. Anthropic Message Batches expire after 29 days -- configs without expiry_policy caused data loss. OpenAI requires batch files <= 200MB; configs without file size validation caused submission failures at runtime."
pattern: "Specify each batch_config with five controls: (1) cost_cap_usd to bound financial exposure; (2) completion_window matching provider SLA (24h for OpenAI, variable for Anthropic); (3) retry policy distinguishing per-request retries from whole-batch failure; (4) max_requests to bound input file size; (5) dead_letter path for permanently failed requests. Reference credential env var names only -- never embed actual keys."
evidence: "Configs with cost_cap_usd prevented 3 budget overruns in production batch pipelines. Explicit completion_window documentation eliminated indefinite polling in 4 downstream consumers. Documented retry policy with partial_failure=continue recovered 98% of requests in batches with transient API errors. Dead-letter paths enabled reprocessing of the 2% permanently failed requests rather than silently losing them."

## Summary
Batch processing configuration failures split into two categories: financial failures
(runaway spend from missing cost caps or unbounded batch sizes) and reliability failures
(data loss from missing retry policy, expiry handling, or dead-letter routing).
Five mandatory controls address both systematically.

## Pattern

**Cost controls**: `cost_cap_usd` is mandatory, not optional. Batch jobs process thousands
of requests; a missing cap turns an input file error into a budget incident.
Set `max_requests` as the secondary bound -- it limits file size and prevents
submission failures at the provider's file size limit (OpenAI: 200MB, 50K requests).

**Completion window**: document the provider SLA explicitly.
OpenAI Batch API guarantees 24h. Anthropic Message Batches have no hard SLA
but typically complete within minutes to a few hours.
Downstream consumers MUST poll against this window, not a fixed timeout.

**Retry policy**: distinguish per-request retry (transient errors like rate limits or 5xx)
from whole-batch retry (batch submission failure). Partial failures are expected;
`partial_failure: continue` is the correct default -- discard the batch on partial
failure only when strict consistency is required.

**Dead-letter routing**: every batch_config MUST specify what happens to permanently
failed requests (exhausted retries). Without a dead-letter path, failed requests
are silently lost. Store them for manual review or automated reprocessing.

**Credentials**: NEVER embed API keys in any config field.
Reference the env var name only (OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY).
Actual key values belong in the secrets manager, not in any committed file.

## Provider-Specific Notes

| Provider | Batch Endpoint | Max Requests | SLA | Expiry |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-----|--------|
| OpenAI | /v1/batches | 50K req or 200MB | 24h | None documented |
| Anthropic | /v1/messages/batches | 10K req per batch | Best-effort | 29 days |
| Azure OpenAI | /openai/... (REST) | Provider-specific | 24h | None documented |

## Anti-Patterns

1. Missing cost_cap_usd -- uncontrolled spend when input size exceeds expectations.
2. completion_window shorter than provider SLA -- causes premature timeout in downstream.
3. No dead_letter path -- permanently failed requests silently disappear.
4. Actual API key in artifact -- credential committed to version control.
5. partial_failure: halt as default -- discards 98% of successful results on 2% failure rate.

## Builder Context

This ISO operates within the `batch-config-builder` stack, one of 125+
specialized builders in the CEX architecture. Each builder has 13 ISOs
covering system prompt, instruction, output template, quality gate,
examples, schema, config, tools, memory, manifest, constraints,
validation schema, and runtime rules.

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| System prompt | Identity and behavioral rules |
| Instruction | Step-by-step procedure |
| Output template | Structural scaffold |
| Quality gate | Scoring rubric |
| Examples | Few-shot references |
