# Collaboration: batch-config-builder

## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "what provider, model, cost cap, and retry policy
does this batch job need?"
I do not schedule when the job runs. I do not orchestrate multi-step pipelines.
I specify async bulk API job parameters so batch processing is cost-controlled and reliable.

## Crew Compositions

### Crew: "Bulk Inference Pipeline"
```
  1. env-config-builder -> "API key env vars, storage credentials"
  2. batch-config-builder -> "async bulk job parameters (provider, model, cost, retry)"
  3. schedule-builder -> "cron trigger for when to submit the batch"
  4. workflow-builder -> "orchestration: trigger -> submit -> poll -> process results"
```

### Crew: "Async Evaluation Pipeline"
```
  1. scoring-rubric-builder -> "evaluation criteria"
  2. batch-config-builder -> "batch job for bulk LLM judge evaluation"
  3. llm-judge-builder -> "per-request scoring prompt"
  4. output-template-builder -> "result aggregation format"
```

### Crew: "Cost-Optimized Data Processing"
```
  1. env-config-builder -> "credentials and storage paths"
  2. batch-config-builder -> "OpenAI/Anthropic batch job configuration"
  3. runtime-rule-builder -> "sync API fallback for time-sensitive requests"
  4. feature-flag-builder -> "toggle between batch and sync mode"
```

## Handoff Protocol

### I Receive
- seeds: provider (openai/anthropic), model ID, use case description
- optional: expected request volume, cost budget, completion window SLA, storage paths
- optional: existing env_config artifact path (for credential env var reference)

### I Produce
- batch_config artifact (.md + .yaml frontmatter)
- committed to: `P09_config/examples/p09_bc_{name_slug}.md`

### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons

## Builders I Depend On
- env-config-builder: provides API credential env var names and storage credential env vars

## Builders That Depend On Me

| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| workflow-builder | Batch job is a step; workflow needs job config to build submission + poll logic |
| schedule-builder | Schedule needs to know what job to trigger (references batch_config id) |
| output-template-builder | Output format (JSONL schema) defines result structure for downstream processing |
| llm-judge-builder | Bulk evaluation jobs reference batch_config for how to submit judge prompts |

## Escalation Rules
- If user requests cron timing: redirect to schedule-builder
- If user requests multi-step pipeline: redirect to workflow-builder
- If user requests per-request timeout: redirect to runtime-rule-builder
- If user requests on/off toggle for batch mode: redirect to feature-flag-builder
