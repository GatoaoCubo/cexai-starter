# Memory: event_stream
## Session Patterns
- Partition key selection: ask "what entity needs ordered processing?" -- that field is the partition key.
- Retention sizing: retention_hours should cover at least the slowest consumer's replay window. 7 days (168h) is a safe default.
- Consumer groups: every consumer that needs independent offset tracking needs its own group.
- Delivery semantics: at_least_once is the default. exactly_once only when financial or idempotency is provably impossible.
## Common Mistakes
- No partition key: loses per-entity ordering. Always specify partition_key.
- Only one consumer group: if analytics and processing read the same stream, they need separate groups.
- Missing schema registry: without a registry, schema evolution becomes breaking changes.
- Confusing retention with backup: retention is for consumer replay, not disaster recovery.
## Vocabulary
- "Topic" = Kafka term for event_stream
- "Stream" = Kinesis/Flink/Pulsar term for event_stream
- "Consumer group" = set of consumers that share an offset (load balanced within the group)
- "Offset" = position in the stream (each consumer group tracks its own)
- "Lag" = how far behind the consumer is from the latest event
## Throughput Sizing Guide
| Events/sec | Partitions | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| < 1000 | 3-6 | Single service |
| 1k-10k | 6-12 | Multi-service |
| 10k-100k | 12-24 | High traffic |
| > 100k | 24+ | Platform-scale |

## Memory Persistence Checklist

- Verify memory type matches taxonomy (entity, episodic, procedural, working)
- Validate retention policy aligns with data lifecycle rules
- Cross-reference with memory_scope for boundary correctness
- Check for stale entries that need decay or pruning

## Memory Pattern

```yaml
# Memory lifecycle
type: classified
retention: defined
scope: bounded
decay: configured
```

```bash
python _tools/cex_compile.py {FILE}
python _tools/cex_memory_update.py --check
```
