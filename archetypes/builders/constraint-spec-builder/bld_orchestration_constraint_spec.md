# Collaboration: constraint-spec-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "what are the parameters and constraints for this constraint spec?"
I specify constraint spec configurations so agents and pipelines can use them.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Structured Generation"
```
  1. constraint-spec-builder -> decode constraint
  2. prompt-template-builder -> prompt with constraint
  3. output-validator-builder -> post-gen validation
```
### Crew: "Prompt Engineering"
```
  1. constraint-spec-builder -> output constraint
  2. system-prompt-builder -> agent identity
  3. prompt-version-builder -> version tracking
```

## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
1. seeds: constraint spec purpose, target system, constraints
2. optional: specific parameter values, upstream artifact references
### I Produce
1. constraint_spec artifact (.md + .yaml frontmatter)
2. committed to: `cex/P03_prompt/examples/p03_constraint_{name}.md`
### I Signal
1. signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
2. if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons
## Builders I Depend On
None — independent builder (layer 0).
