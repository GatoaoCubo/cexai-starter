# Domain Knowledge: constraint_spec
## Executive Summary
Constraint spec — rules that govern the LLM decoder during generation (grammar, regex, enum, schema). Produced as P03 artifacts with concrete parameters and rationale.
## Spec Table
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Pillar | P03 |
| llm_function | CONSTRAIN |
| Max bytes | 2048 |
| Density min | 0.85 |
| Machine format | yaml |
## Patterns
| Pattern | Description | When to use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Regex | Constrain output to match regex pattern | IDs, codes, formatted strings |
| Enum/choice | Force selection from predefined values | Categories, status fields, yes/no |
| JSON schema | Constrain output to valid JSON matching schema | Structured data extraction |
| Grammar (CFG) | Context-free grammar constraining token sequence | Complex structured formats, DSLs |
## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why it fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| Constraint too strict | Rejects valid outputs, LLM loops or fails to generate |
| No fallback | Hard constraint failure crashes pipeline instead of graceful degrade |
| Provider-specific syntax | Constraint only works on one provider, not portable |
| Constraint in prompt only | Natural language constraints are soft — LLM may ignore them |
## Application
1. Identify the use case and constraints
2. Select apownte pattern from the table above
3. Define concrete parameter values with rationale
4. Validate against SCHEMA.md required fields
5. Check body size <= 2048 bytes
6. Verify id matches `^p03_constraint_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$`
