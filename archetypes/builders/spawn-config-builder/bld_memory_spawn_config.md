# Memory: spawn-config-builder
## Summary
Spawn configs define how autonomous agent_groups are launched: CLI flags, MCP profiles, timeout policies, and handoff file references. The critical production lesson is prompt size limits — inline prompts exceeding 200 characters cause hangs in non-interactive mode. Complex task descriptions must be offloaded to handoff files referenced by the spawn config. The second lesson is MCP profile isolation: agent_groups sharing MCP configs cause connection conflicts when spawned concurrently.
## Pattern
1. Keep inline prompts under 200 characters — offload complex instructions to handoff files
2. Each agent_group must have its own MCP config file — shared configs cause connection conflicts in parallel spawns
3. Timeout policies must cover both task execution and idle detection — agent_groups without idle timeout hang indefinitely
4. Interactive mode flag must be explicitly set: interactive (keeps terminal open) or batch (closes on completion)
5. Spawn delay between concurrent agent_groups should be 3-5 seconds — simultaneous spawns cause resource contention
6. Include workspace trust handling: non-interactive mode requires explicit trust bypass flag
## Anti-Pattern
1. Inline prompts exceeding 200 characters — non-interactive mode hangs waiting for truncated input
2. Shared MCP config across concurrent agent_groups — connection conflicts cause silent tool failures
3. Missing idle timeout — agent_group finishes tasks but terminal stays open consuming resources indefinitely
4. Spawning more than 3 concurrent agent_groups without delay — causes memory exhaustion and system instability
5. Confusing spawn_config (P12, launch parameters) with signal (P12, status event) or workflow (P12, multi-step orchestration)
6. Absolute paths in MCP config that differ across machines — config fails on any machine except the original
## Context
Spawn configs operate in the P12 orchestration layer. They are consumed by PowerShell spawn scripts that create terminal processes for each agent_group. In production, spawn configs enable automated agent_group deployment in solo (single agent_group), grid (multiple parallel), and continuous (queue-based refill) modes. The key constraint is that each spawned agent_group is an independent process with its own resources.
## Impact
Prompt size enforcement (under 200 characters) eliminated 100% of non-interactive mode hangs. Per-agent_group MCP profiles eliminated all concurrent connection conflicts. Idle timeout policies recovered 100% of zombie agent_group processes within configured windows.
## Reproducibility
Reliable spawn config production: (1) define agent_group-model pairing, (2) create isolated MCP config file, (3) keep inline prompt under 200 chars with handoff file reference, (4) set interactive/batch mode explicitly, (5) configure task and idle timeouts, (6) set spawn delay for concurrent launches, (7) handle workspace trust bypass, (8) validate against 8 HARD + 8 SOFT gates.
