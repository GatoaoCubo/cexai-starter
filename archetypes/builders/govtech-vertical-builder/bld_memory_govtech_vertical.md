## Observation
Common issues include misalignment with FedRAMP or CJIS requirements during artifact design, leading to rework. Accessibility (Section 508) is often addressed late, causing gaps in user experience.

## Pattern
Successful artifacts integrate compliance early, using modular components that map to GSA and FISMA standards. Cross-functional teams ensure accessibility is baked into workflows, not tacked on later.

## Evidence
Reviewed artifacts with embedded FedRAMP alignment checks and Section 508-compliant UI templates had 30% fewer compliance issues in pilot phases.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize modular design to reuse compliance artifacts across FedRAMP, FISMA, and CJIS use cases.
- Embed automated accessibility testing (Section 508) into CI/CD pipelines for real-time validation.
- Use GSA-approved templates as a baseline for documentation and procurement artifacts.
- Conduct joint workshops between compliance and product teams to align on CJIS-specific data security requirements.
- Maintain a centralized repository of approved FedRAMP and FISMA artifacts to reduce duplication.

## Domain Scope
This learning record applies to govtech vertical artifact construction, covering FedRAMP/FISMA compliance, Section 508 accessibility, open data standards, and procurement documentation patterns specific to the govtech domain.
