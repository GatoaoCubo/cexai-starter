## Domain Overview
The govtech vertical covers technology solutions for government agencies -- federal, state, and local -- where compliance is not optional and regulatory specificity determines contract eligibility. The two dominant federal frameworks are FedRAMP (cloud authorization) and FISMA (information security management). FedRAMP has three impact levels: Low, Moderate, and High; most government SaaS solutions require Moderate or High. FISMA categorizes systems using the same Low/Moderate/High scale per FIPS 199.

The CJIS Security Policy (SP 20-01, v5.9.1) governs any system touching criminal justice data -- background checks, incident reports, biometrics. GSA Schedules (IT Schedule 70 / MAS) and StateRAMP (state-level FedRAMP equivalent) are the two primary procurement vehicles. Section 508 / WCAG 2.1 AA is the accessibility mandate for all citizen-facing digital services. High-ACV govtech deals ($50K-$500K) require naming these standards precisely; vague "federal compliance" language is a disqualifier.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Definition | Source |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| FedRAMP Moderate/High | Cloud authorization levels: Moderate for most SaaS (eMASS-tracked), High for systems with national security data | FedRAMP.gov / NIST SP 800-37 |
| FISMA Categorization | Low/Moderate/High per FIPS 199; determines NIST SP 800-53 control baseline required | FISMA (44 USC 3551) |
| CJIS Security Policy SP 20-01 | FBI-issued policy governing criminal justice data: access, encryption, audit requirements | DOJ CJIS v5.9.1 |
| GSA Schedule (MAS) | Multiple Award Schedule: pre-negotiated federal contract vehicle (replaces IT Schedule 70) | GSA Acquisition Portal |
| StateRAMP | State-equivalent of FedRAMP; separate authorization per state for cloud services | StateRAMP.org |
| Section 508 / WCAG 2.1 AA | Federal accessibility law (29 USC 794d); technical standard is WCAG 2.1 Level AA | Access Board / W3C |
| NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 | Security and privacy control catalog; organized by 20 control families (AC, AU, SC, etc.) | NIST |
| RMF (Risk Management Framework) | 7-step process: Prepare, Categorize, Select, Implement, Assess, Authorize, Monitor | NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 |
| ATO (Authority to Operate) | Authorization issued by AO (Authorizing Official) after RMF completion | NIST/FedRAMP |
| CMMI Level | Capability Maturity Model Integration; GovTech contracts sometimes require CMMI Level 3+ | CMMI Institute |

## Industry Standards
- FedRAMP Authorization (Moderate / High impact levels) -- marketplace.fedramp.gov
- FISMA (44 USC 3551) + FIPS 199 categorization
- NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (20 control families)
- NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 (RMF 7-step process)
- CJIS Security Policy v5.9.1 (DOJ, SP 20-01)
- Section 508 / WCAG 2.1 AA (29 USC 794d)
- GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) -- sam.gov
- StateRAMP Authorized Products List
- CMMI Level 3 (for development/delivery maturity requirements)
- OMB Circular A-130 (federal information resource management)

## Common Patterns
1. FedRAMP Moderate is the minimum bar for most federal SaaS; High is required for systems with law enforcement, intelligence, or financial benefit data.
2. CJIS requires AES-256 encryption, two-factor authentication, and role-based access for any system touching criminal justice records.
3. GSA MAS procurement path shortens sales cycle by ~60% vs. full FAR acquisition; requires SAM.gov registration and GSA Schedule award.
4. StateRAMP authorization is state-specific and does not transfer; a FedRAMP-authorized product still needs StateRAMP for state deployments.
5. Section 508 WCAG 2.1 AA VPATs (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template) are required at procurement; testing must include screen readers (JAWS, NVDA).
6. CMMI Level 3 is a differentiator in large federal software development contracts; often required for DoD and intelligence community work.

## Pitfalls
- Generic "FedRAMP certified" without naming impact level (Moderate vs. High) -- fails procurement review.
- Assuming FedRAMP authorization covers state contracts -- StateRAMP is a separate authorization process.
- CJIS non-compliance via shared credentials or missing audit logs -- immediate disqualification from law enforcement RFPs.
- Missing WCAG 2.1 AA VPAT at proposal stage -- common cause of accessibility-based proposal rejection.
- Conflating GSA SAM registration with GSA Schedule award -- registration is a prerequisite, not the contract vehicle.
- FISMA continuous monitoring lapses -- ATO can be revoked mid-contract, triggering termination clauses.
