## Phase 1: RESEARCH  
1. Identify applicable federal regulations (FedRAMP, FISMA, CJIS).  
2. Map compliance frameworks to GSA contract requirements.  
3. Analyze use cases for secure data handling in federal agencies.  
4. Review Section 508 accessibility standards for digital systems.  
5. Evaluate existing govtech artifacts for alignment with P01.  
6. Document stakeholder needs for vertical-specific inject functions.  

## Phase 2: COMPOSE  
1. Align artifact structure with bld_schema_govtech_vertical.md (govtech_vertical, P01).  
2. Use bld_output_template_govtech_vertical.md to draft overview and compliance sections.  
3. Populate FedRAMP and FISMA requirements in "Regulatory Alignment" block.  
4. Detail CJIS data security protocols in "Technical Controls" section.  
5. Embed Section 508 accessibility checks in "User Experience" module.  
6. Reference GSA contract clauses in "Procurement Compliance" tab.  
7. Add use-case scenarios for federal agency deployments.  
8. Cross-reference schema fields with template placeholders.  
9. Finalize artifact with metadata (version, author, compliance status).  

## Phase 3: VALIDATE  
- [ ] Verify FedRAMP authorization level (Moderate or High) is explicitly stated.
- [ ] Confirm FISMA categorization (Low/Moderate/High) matches artifact scope.
- [ ] Ensure CJIS Security Policy version (SP 20-01) is cited for law enforcement data.
- [ ] Validate Section 508 WCAG 2.1 AA criteria are mapped to specific UI requirements.
- [ ] Confirm GSA Schedule or StateRAMP reference is present for procurement path.
- [ ] Confirm artifact adheres to bld_schema_govtech_vertical.md ID pattern and required fields.
