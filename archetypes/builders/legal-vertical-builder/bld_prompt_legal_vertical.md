## Phase 1: RESEARCH  
1. Analyze privilege logs for attorney-client confidentiality patterns  
2. Map billable hour tracking methods across law firm accounting systems  
3. Audit contract clauses for recurring legal terminology in M&A agreements  
4. Identify use cases for privilege in litigation discovery processes  
5. Benchmark contract analysis tools against legal tech industry standards  
6. Document regulatory frameworks affecting billable hour reporting  

## Phase 2: COMPOSE
1. Align artifact structure with bld_schema_legal_vertical.md's legal_vertical hierarchy.
2. Write privilege section covering attorney-client privilege (ABA Rule 1.6) and work-product doctrine (FRCP 26(b)(3)).
3. Implement billable hour tracking logic with UTBMS task/activity codes in JSON format per schema.
4. Extract contract analysis patterns from sample NDAs and SLAs; map to EDRM model for eDiscovery use cases.
5. Embed use case examples in "litigation", "compliance", and "matter management" subsections.
6. Reference ABA Model Rule 5.3 (supervision of non-lawyer assistants) for AI tool use cases.
7. Cross-reference schema requirements with bld_output_template_legal_vertical.md metadata fields.
8. Add iManage/NetDocuments DMS integration patterns for document management.
9. Include legal hold / litigation hold procedures and document retention policies.
10. Finalize artifact with P01 pillar metadata and legal_vertical classification.

## Phase 3: VALIDATE
- [ ] [OK] Verify schema compliance with bld_schema_legal_vertical.md's required fields.

- [ ] [OK] Ensure privilege section covers both A-C privilege and work-product doctrine.
- [ ] [OK] Validate eDiscovery workflows against EDRM model phases.
- [ ] [OK] Confirm ABA Rule 5.3 compliance documented for AI assistant use cases.
- [ ] [OK] Validate contract analysis outputs against bld_output_template_legal_vertical.md structure.
