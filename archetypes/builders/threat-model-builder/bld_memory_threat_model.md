## Observation

This ISO records a threat model: the assets worth protecting and the attacker profiles that target them.
Common issues include incomplete threat scenarios, siloed input from narrow stakeholders, and over-reliance on generic templates that ignore AI-specific attack vectors (e.g., data poisoning, model inversion).

## Pattern
Effective models use structured frameworks (e.g., STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK) tailored to AI systems, integrate cross-functional input (security, engineering, domain experts), and emphasize iterative refinement through scenario-based validation.

## Evidence
Reviewed artifacts from healthcare and finance domains showed improved coverage when threat models explicitly addressed adversarial training data and inference-time evasion techniques.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize AI-specific threat categories (e.g., data integrity, model robustness) over generic templates.
- Involve diverse stakeholders early to identify non-technical risks (e.g., reputational, legal).
- Use iterative workshops to refine scenarios and validate assumptions with red-team exercises.
- Link threats directly to mitigation strategies (e.g., differential privacy, input validation).
- Document assumptions and limitations to enable model evolution as AI systems mature.
| Common: missing STRIDE coverage | Address all 6 STRIDE categories or justify omissions |
| Common: no mitigation for each threat | Every threat entry must have a mitigation strategy |
