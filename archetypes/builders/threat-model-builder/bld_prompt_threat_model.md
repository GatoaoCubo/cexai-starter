## Phase 1: RESEARCH  

This ISO records a threat model: the assets worth protecting and the attacker profiles that target them.
1. Identify AI system components: enumerate data flows, APIs, model endpoints, training pipelines, and interfaces.  
2. Build asset inventory: classify each component by sensitivity (Critical/High/Medium/Low) and owner.  
3. Enumerate threat actors: external attackers (nation-state, criminal, researcher), malicious insiders, automated bots.  
4. Map AI-specific attack vectors: data poisoning (AML.T0020), model inversion (AML.T0024), adversarial examples (AML.T0015), model extraction (AML.T0005).  
5. Review prior incidents: search CVE database, MITRE ATT&CK for AI, and internal incident history.  
6. Identify regulatory context: GDPR Art. 32, EU AI Act Art. 9, NIST AI RMF GOVERN function.  

## Phase 2: COMPOSE (STRIDE per component)  
1. For each asset, apply STRIDE systematically:  
   - S (Spoofing): Can an attacker impersonate a user, service, or data source?  
   - T (Tampering): Can training data, model weights, or outputs be modified?  
   - R (Repudiation): Can actions be denied -- is there sufficient audit logging?  
   - I (Information Disclosure): Can sensitive data or model internals be extracted?  
   - D (Denial of Service): Can the system be overwhelmed or degraded?  
   - E (Elevation of Privilege): Can an attacker gain unauthorized model or system access?  
2. For each threat, assign: Likelihood (H/M/L), Impact (H/M/L), CVSS base score (0-10).  
3. Map each threat to MITRE ATT&CK or MITRE ATLAS technique ID.  
4. Assign mitigations from NIST CSF (Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover), ISO 27001 Annex A, or OWASP Top 10.  
5. Prioritize by risk = Likelihood x Impact; Critical risks require immediate mitigation plan with owner and due date.  
6. Add AI-specific addendum per MITRE ATLAS if ML models are in scope.  

## Phase 3: VALIDATE  
- [ ] All 6 STRIDE categories addressed for each in-scope asset.  
- [ ] Every threat has a CVSS score and MITRE technique ID.  
- [ ] Mitigations are actionable (specific control, owner, due date) -- not generic ("add more security").  
- [ ] AI-specific threats (data poisoning, model inversion) addressed if ML pipeline is in scope.  
- [ ] At least one peer review or red team exercise referenced as validation evidence.  
- [ ] Document signed off by security lead and approved by compliance officer.
