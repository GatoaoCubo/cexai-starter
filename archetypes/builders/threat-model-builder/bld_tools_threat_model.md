## CEX Production Tools

This ISO records a threat model: the assets worth protecting and the attacker profiles that target them.
| Tool | Purpose | When |
|------|---------|------|
| cex_compile.py | Compiles threat model artifact to YAML + validates frontmatter | After draft completion |
| cex_score.py | Runs 3-layer quality scoring (structural + rubric + semantic) | Post-draft before publish |
| cex_retriever.py | Finds similar threat models and relevant KCs for F3 injection | During F3 INJECT phase |
| cex_doctor.py | Validates artifact structure, required fields, and ID patterns | Pre-commit validation |

## External Security Tools (reference integration)
| Tool | Purpose | When |
|------|---------|------|
| MITRE ATT&CK Navigator | Maps threats to ATT&CK techniques, visualize coverage | During threat enumeration |
| OWASP Threat Dragon | Diagrammatic STRIDE threat modeling with export | During Phase 1 RESEARCH |
| Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool | Automated STRIDE analysis for system diagrams | During Phase 2 COMPOSE |
| Shodan / Censys | Attack surface discovery for external assets | Scope validation |
