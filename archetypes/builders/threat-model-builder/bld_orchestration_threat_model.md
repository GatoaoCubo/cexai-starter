## Crew Role  

This ISO records a threat model: the assets worth protecting and the attacker profiles that target them.
Identifies potential threats, maps attack vectors, and models risk scenarios to inform security design and mitigation strategies.  

## Receives From  
| Builder       | What                  | Format      |  
|---------------|-----------------------|-------------|  
| System Design | Architecture diagrams | JSON        |  
| Compliance    | Regulatory requirements | CSV         |  
| Threat Intel  | External threat data  | API         |  

## Produces For  
| Builder       | What                  | Format      |  
|---------------|-----------------------|-------------|  
| Security Team | Threat model          | JSON        |  
| Risk Team     | Risk assessment       | Markdown    |  
| Design Team   | Mitigation roadmap    | Custom      |  

## Boundary  
Does NOT enforce safety policies (handled by safety_policy) or implement runtime filters (handled by guardrail). Focuses solely on pre-deployment threat/risk analysis.
