## Production Tools
| Tool | Status | Tag | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `brain_query` | CONDITIONAL | [MCP] | Surface existing type_def artifacts, related schemas, domain context |
| `validate_artifact` | CONDITIONAL | [PLANNED] | Run SCHEMA.md hard gates against produced artifact |
| `cex_forge` | CONDITIONAL | [PLANNED] | Register type_def into CEX artifact registry |
| `glob` | ACTIVE | [LOCAL] | Find existing type_def files under `archetypes/` for collision check |
| `read` | ACTIVE | [LOCAL] | Read sibling type_def artifacts to check inheritance targets |
## Data Sources
| Source | What to Extract |
|---|---|
| `P06_schema/_schema.yaml` | max_bytes, naming pattern, llm_function for type_def |
| `archetypes/builders/*/SCHEMA.md` | Sibling schemas to verify no kind collision |
| Brain index (via `brain_query`) | Existing type_defs by domain, related constraints |
| Domain KNOWLEDGE.md files | Base type vocabulary for the target domain |
## brain_query Usage [IF MCP]
```
brain_query "type_def {type_name}"          # Find existing definitions for this type
brain_query "base_type constraints {domain}" # Find constraint patterns in domain
brain_query "composition union {type_name}"  # Find union/intersection patterns
```
Always run before composing — prevents duplicate type_def creation.
