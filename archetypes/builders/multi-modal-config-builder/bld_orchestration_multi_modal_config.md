# Collaboration: multi-modal-config-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "how should non-text inputs be processed and routed?"
I do not implement image analysis. I do not process audio. I do not define model capabilities.
I configure the constraints, routing, and preprocessing for multi-modal inputs.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Multi-Modal Agent"
```
  1. multi-modal-config-builder -> "modality constraints and routing"
  2. vision-tool-builder -> "image analysis implementation"
  3. audio-tool-builder -> "audio processing implementation"
  4. agent-card-builder -> "agent deployment with modality support"
```
### Crew: "Budget-Aware Multi-Modal"
```
  1. multi-modal-config-builder -> "token costs per modality"
  2. context-window-config-builder -> "budget allocation accounting for modalities"
  3. prompt-template-builder -> "template with multi-modal content blocks"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: target use case, supported modalities, target models
- optional: budget constraints, volume expectations
### I Produce
- multi_modal_config artifact (.yaml, max 2KB)
- committed to: `P04_tools/examples/p04_mmc_{capability}.yaml`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality from QUALITY_GATES)
## Builders I Depend On
