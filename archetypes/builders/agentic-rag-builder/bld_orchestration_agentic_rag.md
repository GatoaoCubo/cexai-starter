| User Interface| Query intent          | Text        |  
| Retrieval     | Ranked document snippets| JSON        |  
| Feedback Loop | User evaluation data  | YAML        |  

## Produces For  
| Builder       | What                  | Format      |  
|---------------|-----------------------|-------------|  
| Generation    | Contextual response   | Text        |  
| Metadata Store| Query-document mapping| JSON        |  
| UI/UX         | Structured output     | HTML/Markdown|  
| Optimization  | Performance metrics   | CSV         |
