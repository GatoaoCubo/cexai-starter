## Domain Overview
Agentic RAG extends vanilla RAG by adding a **retrieve->reflect->re-query loop**: the agent evaluates retrieved documents, decides whether they are sufficient, and issues corrective sub-queries before generating. This loop is the defining characteristic separating agentic RAG from static RAG pipelines.

Published variants differ on where and how the reflection happens: Self-RAG (Asai 2023) uses special reflection tokens trained into the model; CRAG (Yan 2024) adds an external retrieval evaluator that triggers web search when documents are irrelevant; RAG-Fusion generates multiple sub-queries and reranks via RRF; Adaptive RAG classifies query complexity to choose single-hop vs multi-hop retrieval. All share the core loop but differ in trigger mechanism and correction strategy.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Definition | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Retrieve->Reflect->Re-query loop | Core agentic pattern: retrieve, assess relevance, issue corrective queries if needed | Asai et al. 2023 |
| Self-RAG | Trains model to emit [Retrieve], [ISREL], [ISSUP], [ISUSE] tokens; retrieval is model-driven | Asai et al. 2023 (arXiv:2310.11511) |
| CRAG (Corrective RAG) | External retrieval evaluator scores retrieved docs; triggers web search on low-confidence | Yan et al. 2024 (arXiv:2401.15884) |
| RAG-Fusion | Multi-query generation + Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) reranking across result sets | Rackauckas 2024 |
| Adaptive RAG | Query complexity classifier (simple/multi-step/iterative) routes to appropriate pipeline | Jeong et al. 2024 (arXiv:2403.14403) |
| ReAct over retrievers | Interleaves Reason + Act (retrieve) steps in a trace; LangGraph native pattern | Yao et al. 2023 |
| Reflection trigger | Condition that activates re-query: low similarity score, contradictory evidence, missing entity | LangGraph agentic RAG |
| Corrective fallback | Action taken on failed retrieval: web search (CRAG), sub-query decomposition, or abort | Yan et al. 2024 |

## Industry Standards
- Self-RAG: Asai et al. 2023 (arXiv:2310.11511) -- self-reflection token training
- CRAG: Yan et al. 2024 (arXiv:2401.15884) -- retrieval evaluator + corrective action
- RAG-Fusion: Rackauckas 2024 -- multi-query RRF reranking
- Adaptive RAG: Jeong et al. 2024 (arXiv:2403.14403) -- complexity-based routing
- LangGraph agentic RAG (retrieve->grade->generate StateGraph)
- LlamaIndex AgentRunner (tool-calling with retrieval as a tool)

## Common Patterns
1. **Loop termination contract**: max_reflection_iterations (default 3-4) prevents infinite re-query spirals.
2. **Reflection scoring**: use similarity threshold or LLM grader to decide if retrieved docs are relevant.
3. **Corrective fallback chain**: irrelevant docs -> sub-query decomposition -> web search -> abort with disclaimer.
4. **Multi-source fusion**: combine vector store + graph store + web results via RRF before generation.
5. **Tool plan coverage**: document which tools (retrieve_vector, retrieve_graph, generate_subquery, reflect_plan) map to each loop phase.

## Pitfalls
- Infinite loops: no termination condition on re-query iterations leads to runaway token spend.
- Conflating Self-RAG (model-intrinsic) with ReAct (tool-calling): they require different configurations.
- Hallucinated reflection: agent claims documents are insufficient without a measurable relevance signal.
- Missing corrective fallback: without CRAG-style web search or sub-query, failure mode is silent hallucination.
- Treating Adaptive RAG as generic routing: complexity classifier must be calibrated per domain query distribution.
