# Memory: course-module-builder

## Summary
Modules fail when learning_outcomes are verb-agnostic ("understand X") instead of Bloom-measurable ("analyze X by classifying 5 cases"). The second failure is assessment-objective drift: objectives target Bloom level 4 (Analyze) but the quiz tests level 1 (Remember). The third is time overestimation: designers plan 45-minute modules; learners disengage at 18 minutes (Duolingo, Khan Academy data).

## Pattern
1. Every learning_outcome starts with a Bloom taxonomy verb (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create). Verbs like "know", "learn", "understand" are REJECTED.
2. Assessment items map 1:1 to outcomes and MATCH the Bloom level (outcome="evaluate arguments" -> assessment requires critique, not recall).
3. Design for Kirkpatrick levels: L1 Reaction (post-survey), L2 Learning (quiz), L3 Behavior (application task), L4 Results (business metric). Most modules stop at L2 -- document if that is the design intent.
4. Chunk content into 5-10 minute micro-learning units (Duolingo lesson length). Long-form lectures without interaction fail at minute 18.
5. Produce SCORM 2004 4th Edition or xAPI (Tin Can) wrappers for LMS interoperability. Include cmi.core.lesson_status and cmi.core.score.raw mapping.
6. Prerequisites must reference other course_module IDs, not free-text ("Intro to Python" -> p05_cm_python_intro).
7. WCAG 2.2 AA minimum: captions, alt-text, keyboard nav, 4.5:1 contrast, no color-only signals.

## Evidence
Bloom (1956, revised Anderson & Krathwohl 2001) is the canonical cognitive taxonomy. Kirkpatrick-Kirkpatrick (2016, "Kirkpatrick's Four Levels of Training Evaluation") formalizes outcome measurement. ADDIE (Dick & Carey) and SAM (Allen) are dominant design processes. Cohort-based course data (Maven, On Deck) shows 50-70% completion vs <10% for MOOCs, confirming chunking + cohort drive retention.

## Pitfalls
- **Objective-assessment drift**: test items evaluate lower cognitive level than outcome claims.
- **Weak formative loops**: summative-only courses lose learners at minute 10; formative checks every 3-5 minutes sustain engagement.
- **Cognitive overload**: >4 new concepts per 10 minutes violates Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory.
- **Completion != learning**: Kirkpatrick L2 required; L1 NPS alone is vanity.
- **Inaccessible multimedia**: video without captions fails WCAG 1.2.2 and excludes ~15% of learners.
- **Platform lock-in**: hardcoded Articulate/Rise markup breaks SCORM portability -- author against the standard, not the tool.
