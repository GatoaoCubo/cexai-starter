# Collaboration: toolkit-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "what tools does this agent have, what requires confirmation, and what is denied?"
I produce YAML permission bundles for agent tool access: tool definitions with confirmation tiers, deny lists, and MCP endpoint mapping. I do NOT implement tools (N05 operations), define agent identity (system-prompt-builder), model workflows (workflow-primitive-builder), or set routing policy (dispatch-rule-builder).
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Agent Provisioning"
```
  1. system-prompt-builder  -> "defines WHO the agent is — identity, rules, boundaries"
  2. toolkit-builder        -> "defines WHAT TOOLS the agent can use — permissions, tiers, denials"
  3. instruction-builder    -> "defines WHAT the agent does — phases, inputs, outputs"
  4. config-builder         -> "defines HOW the agent operates — naming, paths, limits"
```
### Crew: "Tool Security Audit"
```
  1. toolkit-builder        -> "defines the permission bundle with confirmation tiers"
  2. quality-gate-builder   -> "validates least-privilege compliance and risk coverage"
  3. memory-builder         -> "records tool usage patterns for quarterly review"
```
### Crew: "MCP Integration Pipeline"
```
  1. toolkit-builder        -> "maps tools to MCP server endpoints with availability checks"
  2. config-builder         -> "sets MCP server connection parameters and timeouts"
  3. signal-builder         -> "emits tool execution status signals for monitoring"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: target agent/nucleus name, required operations list, risk profile per operation
- optional: MCP server availability data, existing toolkit overlaps, usage history
### I Produce
- toolkit artifact (YAML, fields: name, tools, category, requires_confirmation, denied_for, max 4096 bytes)
- committed to: `cex/P04_tools/compiled/p04_tk_{name}.yaml`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with tool count and confirmation tier distribution)
- if any write tool lacks confirmation: signal warning with affected tools
## Builders I Depend On
- system-prompt-builder: provides agent identity context for understanding tool needs
- config-builder: provides MCP server connection parameters
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| agent-builder             | references toolkit to know which tools are available |
| instruction-builder       | references toolkit to constrain tool usage in instructions |
| quality-gate-builder      | validates toolkit against least-privilege and risk standards |
| dispatch-rule-builder     | checks toolkit availability before routing tasks |
| skill-loader              | reads toolkit to inject tool lists into agent prompts |
