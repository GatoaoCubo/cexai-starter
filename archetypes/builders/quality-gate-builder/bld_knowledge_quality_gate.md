# Domain Knowledge: quality_gate
## Executive Summary
Quality gates are numeric scoring barriers that block or score artifacts before they ship. Each gate is HARD (binary AND — one failure zeroes the final score) or SOFT (weighted dimension contributing to a 0–10 score). Gates govern one domain and never self-score (`quality: null` always). A gate is a policy; a validator implements it; a rubric defines the scoring dimensions.
## Spec Table
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Pillar | P11 (governance) |
| ID pattern | `p11_qg_{gate_slug}` |
| Required frontmatter fields | 12 |
| HARD gates | 8–10 required; universal H01–H06 always present |
| SOFT gates | 5–20; each weight >= 0.5; weights sum == 100% |
| Max body | 4096 bytes |
| Body sections | 5 (Definition, HARD Gates, SOFT Scoring, Actions, Bypass) |
| Score tiers | GOLDEN >= 9.5 / PUBLISH >= 8.0 / REVIEW >= 7.0 / REJECT < 7.0 |
| Naming | `p11_qg_{slug}.md` |
## Patterns
| Pattern | Rule |
|---------|------|
| HARD gate failure | Sets final score to 0 regardless of all SOFT scores |
| Universal HARD gates | H01 (frontmatter parses), H02 (ID regex), H03 (ID == filename), H04 (kind literal), H05 (quality null), H06 (required fields present) |
| SOFT weight minimum | >= 0.5; weight 1.0 = high utility impact; weight 0.5 = polish |
| Weights invariant | Sum of all SOFT weights MUST equal 100% |
| Scoring formula | `final = hard_pass ? sum(gate * weight) / sum(weights) : 0` |
| Threshold rule | Must be numeric — no vague qualifiers ("good", "acceptable") |
| Bypass conditions | Must include: condition + approver + audit_log + expiry |
## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why it fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| SOFT weight < 0.5 | Creates invisible low-signal dimensions |
| Weights not summing to 100% | Breaks scoring formula invariant; validator rejects |
| Missing H01–H06 | Gate is structurally incomplete; kind-specific gates cannot replace universals |
| `quality` field non-null | Self-scoring forbidden by schema |
| Bypass without expiry | Audit trail incomplete; bypass becomes permanent |
| Vague threshold ("high quality") | Not computable; validator cannot determine pass/fail |
| > 12 HARD gates | Diminishing returns; creates unnecessary brittleness |
| Gate checks producer, not artifact | Gates evaluate the artifact output, not who made it |
## Application
1. Identify the artifact kind this gate protects — sets the `domain` field
2. Write frontmatter: 12 required fields; `quality: null`; `id` matches `p11_qg_{slug}` pattern
3. Write `## Definition` — metric, threshold (numeric), operator, scope
4. Write `## HARD Gates` — include H01–H06 universals; add kind-specific gates up to 10 total
5. Write `## SOFT Scoring` — assign weight >= 0.5 per dimension; verify sum == 100%
6. Write `## Actions` — map score ranges to GOLDEN / PUBLISH / REVIEW / REJECT tiers
7. Write `## Bypass` — condition + approver + audit_log + expiry; mark H01 and H05 as never-bypassable
8. Verify body <= 4096 bytes; `id` equals filename stem
