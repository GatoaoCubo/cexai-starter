## Production Tools
| Tool | Purpose | When | Status |
|------|---------|------|--------|
| brain_query [MCP] | Search existing quality_gates | Phase 1 (check duplicates) | CONDITIONAL |
| validate_kc.py | Reference pattern for HARD/SOFT gates | Design time | CONDITIONAL |
| validate_artifact.py | Validate any artifact kind | Phase 3 | [PLANNED] |
## Reference Gates (existing)
| Gate | File | Domain |
|------|------|--------|
| CEX Quality Gate | P11_feedback/examples/p11_qg_cex_quality.md | Pre-commit |
| Shokunin Pool Gate | P11_feedback/examples/p11_qg_shokunin_pool.md | Pool entry |
| TDD Compliance | P11_feedback/examples/p11_qg_tdd_compliance.md | Testing |

## Tool Permissions

| Category | Tools | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| ALLOWED | Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep | Explicitly permitted |
| DENIED | (none) | Explicitly blocked |
| EFFECTIVE | Bash, Edit, Glob, Grep, Read, Write | ALLOWED minus DENIED |

## Pipeline Integration

1. Created via 8F pipeline from F1-Focus through F8-Furnish
2. Scored by cex_score across three structural layers
3. Compiled by cex_compile for structural validation
4. Retrieved by cex_retriever for context injection
5. Evolved by cex_evolve when quality regresses below target
