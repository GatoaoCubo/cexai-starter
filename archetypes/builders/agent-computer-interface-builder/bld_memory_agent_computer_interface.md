## Observation
Builders often create overly complex schemas that increase latency and token consumption. There is a frequent lack of clear state synchronization between the agent's command and the interface's actual environment state.

## Pattern
Effective interfaces utilize structured, low-latency protocols like JSON-RPC or simplified CLI outputs. Decoupling action definitions from the execution environment ensures better reliability and easier debugging.

## Evidence
Reviewed terminal-based protocols demonstrate higher success rates when using standardized command-response pairs.

## Recommendations
* Use structured, machine-readable output formats (JSON/YAML).
* Define explicit error states for failed command executions.
* Implement a clear separation between action requests and environment state.
* Minimize token overhead via concise, standardized command schemas.
* Ensure the interface provides deterministic feedback for every interaction.
