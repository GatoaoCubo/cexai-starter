## Crew Role
Architects the structured communication protocol and schema that enables an agent to interact with
a specific computing environment via defined commands and state updates. Part of the P08
architecture layer; consumed at F2 BECOME by downstream builder agents.

## Receives From
| Builder (CEX) | What | Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| agent-builder (P02) | Agent capability requirements | YAML/Markdown |
| mcp-server-builder (P04) | Available tool definitions | JSON Schema |
| sandbox-config-builder (P09) | Security boundaries, execution constraints | YAML |

## Produces For
| Builder (CEX) | What | Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| computer-use-builder (P08) | ACI extends with GUI-level control | Markdown/Schema |
| browser-tool-builder (P04) | Boundary handoff for web interactions | Markdown |
| agent-computer-interface-builder | Output artifact: agent_computer_interface | Markdown |

## Boundary
Does NOT perform web automation or DOM scraping (handled by browser-tool-builder).
Does NOT perform visual/pixel-based screen control (handled by computer-use-builder).
Does NOT define agent identity or persona (handled by agent-builder).
