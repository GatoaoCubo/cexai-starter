## Examples

## Golden Example

A properly structured CEX prompt_optimizer artifact shows the before/after transformation with documented rationale:

```yaml
---
id: p03_po_chain_of_thought_boost.md
kind: prompt_optimizer
pillar: P03
quality: null
title: "Chain-of-Thought Boost for Reasoning Tasks"
version: "1.0.0"
domain: "analytical reasoning"
method: DSPy signature optimization
tags: [prompt_optimizer, chain_of_thought, reasoning]
---
```

**Original prompt:**
> "Explain this concept."

**Pass 1 -- Specificity (APE-style candidate generation):**
> "Explain [CONCEPT] in three steps, using concrete examples for each step."
> Rationale: Forces structured output; reduces abstraction drift.

**Pass 2 -- Constraint injection (OPRO-style refinement):**
> "Explain [CONCEPT] in exactly three steps. Each step must include: (1) the principle, (2) a real-world example, (3) a common misconception to avoid."
> Rationale: Prevents hallucination by forcing grounding per step.

**Optimized prompt:** Pass 2 output. Measurable gain: specificity +40%, hallucination risk -30% vs. baseline.

## Anti-Example 1: Vendor tool catalog entry
```yaml
---
tool: PromptHero Optimizer v2.1
vendor: PromptHero Inc.
description: "Automated prompt refinement via API"
---
```
**Why it fails:** Describes a third-party product, not a CEX kind artifact. Missing frontmatter kind/pillar fields. No optimization passes documented. Not a produced artifact -- a vendor reference.

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
