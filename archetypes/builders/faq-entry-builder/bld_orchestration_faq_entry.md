## Crew Role  
Curates and structures frequently asked questions (FAQs) into standardized entries, ensuring consistency and clarity for end-users.  

## Receives From  
| Builder       | What               | Format   |  
|---------------|--------------------|----------|  
| User Research | Raw user queries   | Text     |  
| Content Team  | Draft FAQ entries  | Markdown |  
| Analytics     | Usage statistics   | JSON     |  

## Produces For  
| Builder       | What               | Format   |  
|---------------|--------------------|----------|  
| Knowledge Base| Structured FAQ entry | Markdown |  
| Support Team  | Ready-to-use answers | JSON     |  
| Content Team  | Entry summary      | Text     |  

## Boundary  
Does NOT handle knowledge_card (broader conceptual explanations) or support_macro (agent-specific canned replies). Those are managed by dedicated builders.
