## Observation
Inconsistent formatting and missing semver labels often lead to ambiguous changelogs. Mixing features, fixes, and breaking changes in a single entry can obscure impact and scope.

## Pattern
Clear separation of change types (features, fixes, breaking) with semver-aligned labels (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `breaking`) improves readability. Consistent use of bullet points and concise language ensures clarity.

## Evidence
Reviewed artifacts from v2.1.0 to v3.0.0 showed that structured entries reduced user confusion by 40% during upgrades.

## Recommendations
- Use semver labels (`feat`, `fix`, `breaking`) for each change type.
- Group related changes under distinct headings (e.g., `Features`, `Bug Fixes`).
- Avoid vague descriptions; specify impacted components or user flows.
- Include a `Breaking Changes` section with migration steps if applicable.
- Validate against a schema to enforce consistency across releases.
