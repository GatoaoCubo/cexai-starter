## Quality Gate
## Definition
| metric | threshold | operator | scope |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| ID pattern | ^p01_ch_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+\\.md$ | matches | all changelog files |
## HARD Gates
| ID | Check | Fail Condition |
|----|-------|----------------|
| H01 | YAML frontmatter valid | invalid YAML syntax |
| H02 | ID matches pattern ^p01_ch_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+\\.md$ | ID does not match pattern |
| H03 | kind field equals "changelog" | kind != "changelog" |
| H04 | version field present and SemVer X.Y.Z | missing or non-SemVer version |
| H05 | At least one of: Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed/Deprecated/Security section present | no change sections found |
| H06 | MAJOR version bump includes Migration section | MAJOR bump without migration guide |
| H07 | No fabricated issue IDs (issue refs must be integers or alphanumeric) | fictional issue ID format |
## SOFT Scoring
| Dim | Dimension | Weight | Scoring Guide |
|-----|-----------|--------|---------------|
| D1 | Section completeness | 0.20 | All 6 Keep a Changelog sections present = 1.0; fewer = proportional |
| D2 | Entry precision | 0.20 | Entries are specific and actionable = 1.0; vague = 0.0 |
| D3 | SemVer alignment | 0.15 | Version bump type matches changes = 1.0; mismatch = 0.0 |
| D4 | Breaking change clarity | 0.15 | BREAKING: prefix + migration steps = 1.0; unlabeled = 0.0 |
| D5 | Traceability | 0.15 | Issue/PR IDs linked = 1.0; no references = 0.0 |
| D6 | Imperative language | 0.15 | "Add X", "Fix Y" = 1.0; passive/nominal = 0.5 |
## Actions
| Score | Action |
|-------|--------|
| >= 9.5 | Auto-publish |
| >= 8.0 | Publish |
| >= 7.0 | Require review |
| < 7.0 | Block release |
## Bypass
| conditions | approver | audit trail |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Urgent hotfix with breaking customer impact | CTO | Audit log entry with timestamp and justification |

id: p01_ch_myapp_2_7_1.md
kind: changelog
pillar: P01
title: "MyApp Changelog"
version: "2.7.1"
release_date: "2024-01-15"
author: "jsmith"
domain: "saas-platform"
quality: null
tags: [security, fix]
tldr: "Patch: fix race condition in auth, patch TLS requirement for Docker clients"
---
```
## [2.7.1] - 2024-01-15
### Fixed
- Fix race condition in PostgreSQL 15.2 transaction handling under high load (fixes #4521)
- Fix incorrect token expiration logic in Auth0 SDK v2.1 integration (fixes #4489)
### Security
- Patch TLS requirement: Docker 24.0 now enforces TLS 1.3; older clients receive SSL_ERROR (CVE-2023-44487, affects < 2.7.1)
---
## [2.7.0] - 2024-01-10
### Added
- Add real-time collaboration support via Notion API v3 (PR #4401)
- Add GraphQL query optimization in Hasura for improved data fetch latency
### Changed
- Change authentication token refresh interval from 60m to 30m for security hardening
### Deprecated
- Deprecate v1 REST endpoints -- removal scheduled for 3.0.0
### Removed
- BREAKING: Remove deprecated `/api/v1/` endpoints -- migrate to `/api/v2/` per migration guide
## Anti-Example 1: Missing Keep a Changelog sections and vague entries
**Version:** v2.7.1
**Date:** 2024-01-15
- Added real-time collaboration in Notion.
- Fixed PostgreSQL transaction issues.
- Removed old Stripe endpoints.
**Why it fails:** Uses informal section-free list. No Added/Changed/Fixed/Security structure. Entries vague ("transaction issues" vs the specific race condition). No issue IDs. No CVE for the security patch.
## Anti-Example 2: Wrong version bump + no migration for MAJOR
**Version:** 2.8.0
### Features
- Removed legacy /api/v1/ endpoints.
- Added new auth system.
**Why it fails:** Removing endpoints is a BREAKING change requiring MAJOR bump (3.0.0 not 2.8.0). Section is called "Features" not "Removed" (KAC standard). No Migration section for the breaking removal. Version uses 2-part not SemVer 3-part format.
### H_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (HARD)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (min 3 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream or sibling reference
- Gate: REJECT if < 3 entries (auto-populated by cex_wikilink.py at F6.5)
### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
