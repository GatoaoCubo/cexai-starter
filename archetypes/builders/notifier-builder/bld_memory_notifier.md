# Memory: notifier-builder Learnings

## Pattern: Rate Limit Prevents Provider Bans [score: 9.0]
**Context**: Notifiers without rate_limit hit provider limits during traffic spikes.
**Learning**: Always define rate_limit even for low-volume channels. Twilio suspends numbers
after burst violations. SendGrid downgrades accounts after IP reputation damage.
**Rule derived**: rate_limit is REC but treat as required for any production channel.

## Pattern: Priority Routing Prevents Alert Fatigue [score: 8.5]
**Context**: All-critical notifiers caused on-call engineers to ignore alerts.
**Learning**: critical must mean "page someone now". Misuse of critical degrades response
to genuine incidents. Document timing semantics per priority level in the Template section.
**Rule derived**: Every notifier with priority: critical must justify it in Overview.

## Pattern: Template Vars Prevent Runtime Errors [score: 8.5]
**Context**: Notifiers with undocumented template vars caused KeyError at delivery time.
**Learning**: template_vars frontmatter field must list every `{{var}}` used in the template.
Consumers cannot implement without knowing what data to provide.
**Rule derived**: template_vars list must be exhaustive; missing vars = H05 soft fail.

## Pattern: Retry on Critical = Non-Negotiable [score: 9.0]
**Context**: Critical Slack alert dropped silently during Slack API outage (no retry).
**Learning**: at_least_once delivery_guarantee requires retry_policy. best_effort is only
acceptable for low/normal priority. H09 soft gate added as HARD gate for critical channel.
**Rule derived**: priority: critical -> retry_policy: required (not recommended).

## Anti-Pattern: Notifier as Webhook [score: fail]
**Context**: Builder produced notifier artifact that described receiving HTTP POST events.
**Learning**: Notifier = outbound push only. Any inbound/receive/listen pattern = webhook.
If artifact says "receives", "listens", "handles incoming" -> redirect to webhook-builder.
**Rule derived**: H10 gate added — bidirectional HTTP semantics = immediate REJECT.

## Anti-Pattern: Provider SDK Code in Body [score: fail]
**Context**: Notifier body contained Python sendgrid library call.
**Learning**: Notifier is a spec, not implementation. SDK code inflates bytes, bleeds
implementation detail, and couples spec to language. Code belongs in code-gen output.
**Rule derived**: Body may reference provider endpoint and env var only — no SDK imports.
