## Quality Gate

# Gate: drift_detector

## Definition
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| metric | drift_detector artifact quality score |
| threshold | 7.0 (publish >= 8.0, golden >= 9.5) |
| operator | weighted_sum |
| scope | all artifacts with `kind: drift_detector` |

## HARD Gates
All must pass (AND logic). Any single failure = REJECT.
| ID | Check | Fail Condition |
|---|---|---|
| H01 | Frontmatter parses as valid YAML | Parse error on frontmatter block |
| H02 | ID matches `^p11_dd_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$` | ID has hyphens, uppercase, or missing prefix |
| H03 | ID equals filename stem | id vs filename mismatch |
| H04 | Kind equals literal `drift_detector` | `kind: monitor` or any other value |
| H05 | Quality field is null | `quality: 8.0` or any non-null value |
| H06 | detection_method is declared enum value | Missing or "statistical" (not in enum) |
| H07 | threshold has at least one numeric value | `threshold: "low"` or missing |
| H08 | features_monitored is non-empty list | `features_monitored: []` or generic "all" |
| H09 | alert_rule declared with destination | No alert_rule or missing destination |
| H10 | Tags list >= 3 items and includes "drift_detector" | Too few tags or missing required tag |

## SOFT Scoring
Weights sum to 100%.
| Dimension | Weight | Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| Method-feature alignment | 1.5 | Statistical test appropriate for feature type (KS/PSI for continuous, chi-square/JS for categorical) |
| Threshold calibration | 1.5 | Both warning and critical levels declared with values grounded in domain knowledge |
| Window config completeness | 1.0 | reference_window and production_window both specified |
| Alert rule quality | 1.0 | Destination, frequency, and suppression_window all declared |
| Feature specificity | 1.0 | Named dimensions, not generic; each feature is a real model I/O dimension |
| Boundary clarity | 0.5 | Not regression_check (no code assertions), not benchmark (no eval metrics) |
| Platform declaration | 0.5 | Platform field set (Evidently, Arize, Whylogs, or custom) |
| tldr quality | 0.5 | <= 160 chars, includes method, feature, and threshold |

## Actions
| Score | Tier | Action |
|---|---|---|
| >= 9.5 | Golden | Reference detector spec |
| >= 8.0 | Publish | Deploy to monitoring platform |
| >= 7.0 | Review | Add window_config or calibrate thresholds |
| < 7.0 | Reject | Return with gate failures |

## Never Bypass
- H01 (unparseable YAML)
- H05 (self-scored artifacts)
- H07 (string threshold breaks numeric comparison in monitoring platform)

```
## Overview
Monitors behavioral drift in CEX nucleus output quality metrics. Detects when quality_score, density_score, or gate_pass_rate distributions shift from the 30-day rolling baseline.

## Detection Method
Method: KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) -- nonparametric, no distributional assumptions, works on small samples.
Parameters: two-sample KS statistic; p-value threshold 0.05 warning, 0.10 critical.
Rationale: Quality scores are continuous; KS is preferred over PSI when baseline is not fixed.

## Thresholds
| Level | Value | Interpretation | Action |
|-------|-------|---------------|--------|
| Warning | 0.05 | Mild distribution shift | Alert + investigate recent commits |
| Critical | 0.10 | Significant shift | Alert + trigger quality audit |

WHY THIS IS GOLDEN:
- quality: null (H05 pass)
- id matches `^p11_dd_` (H02 pass)
- kind: drift_detector (H04 pass)
- detection_method: ks (H06 pass)

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
