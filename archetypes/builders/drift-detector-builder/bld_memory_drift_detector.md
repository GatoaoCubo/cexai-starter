observation: "Drift detectors with threshold=0 or 'low' string values produced alert storms. Detectors monitoring 'all features' generically missed actionable signals while firing on noise. Concrete feature lists with calibrated numeric thresholds produced useful alerts in 4/5 test deployments."
pattern: "Always specify features_monitored as named list. Set threshold as numeric float (not string). Include suppression_window in alert_rule to prevent storms. Choose statistical test based on feature type: KS for continuous, chi-square/JS for categorical."
evidence: "5 test deployments: 2 alert-storm failures (threshold misconfigured), 1 missed-signal failure (features: all), 4/5 successes with named features + numeric thresholds."

## Summary
Two decisions dominate drift detector utility: what features to monitor (specific list vs generic "all") and how thresholds are calibrated (numeric vs vague). Generic feature monitoring generates alert fatigue; specific named dimensions produce actionable signals. Numeric thresholds with suppression windows prevent cascade failures after initial detection.

## Pattern
**Named features + calibrated numeric threshold + suppression window.**
1. features_monitored: list specific dimension names, not "all"
2. detection_method: match test to feature type (KS/PSI=continuous, chi-square/JS=categorical)
3. threshold: always float, not string; calibrate against domain-specific baseline variance
4. alert_rule.suppression_window: always set; 1-4h for operational detectors
5. window_config: always declare reference source; rolling baseline > fixed for non-stationary environments

## Anti-Pattern
1. threshold: "low" -- string values fail numeric comparison
2. features_monitored: ["all"] -- too broad, alert fatigue
3. No suppression_window -- cascade alerts on correlated drift
4. Conflating with regression_check -- different detection method, different remediation
5. No window_config reference -- detector has no baseline to compare against
6. PSI on categorical features -- PSI assumes continuous; use JS or chi-square for categoricals
