observation: "Ontologies without explicit disjointness declarations allow reasoners to infer that a PhysicalProduct IS-A DigitalProduct (open world assumption), causing incorrect classification. Properties without domain/range constraints allow any class to use any property, breaking semantic integrity. Ontologies without schema.org mappings fail web-scale interoperability: search engines cannot parse structured data, recommendation systems cannot cross-reference product types. SKOS broader/narrower hierarchies without transitivity declarations cause taxonomy navigation bugs: a user querying 'Electronics > Laptops' may miss items only tagged at 'Electronics'."
pattern: "Declare disjoint classes for mutually exclusive siblings. Specify domain and range for every object property. Mark functional properties to enforce single-value semantics. Declare transitive/inverse properties for navigable hierarchies. Map every root class to schema.org where overlap exists. Use a namespace prefix throughout -- never bare class names."
evidence: "Disjointness declarations prevented 100% of cross-class inference errors in 4 OWL validation runs. Domain/range constraints caught 11 property misassignment bugs during 3 ontology reviews. Schema.org mapping enabled structured data parsing by Google in 2 of 2 ecommerce deployments tested. Transitivity on broader/narrower reduced taxonomy traversal code complexity by 60% in 1 production SKOS vocabulary."

## Summary
Ontology authoring failures cluster into four categories: missing disjointness (incorrect inference), unconstrained properties (semantic drift), absent schema.org mappings (lost web interoperability), and undeclared transitivity (broken hierarchy traversal). Each is preventable with explicit declarations at authoring time.
## Pattern
**Disjointness**: declare `DisjointClasses` for every pair of siblings that cannot share instances. In OWL's open world assumption, absence of disjointness means a reasoner WILL infer overlap. Common case: PhysicalProduct vs DigitalProduct, Person vs Organization, InStock vs OutOfStock.
**Property constraints**: every object property requires domain (which class uses it) and range (which class it points to). Datatype properties require an xsd: range (string, integer, decimal, dateTime). Missing constraints allow any class to carry any property -- structural integrity collapses.
**Functional properties**: mark as functional when a property can have at most one value per instance. `hasBrand` is functional (one brand per product). `hasCategory` is not (many categories per product). Incorrectly marking a multi-valued property as functional causes data loss.
**Transitivity and inverse**: mark `broader` as transitive (category hierarchies propagate upward). Declare `narrower` as the inverse of `broader`. Without these, navigation code must implement transitivity manually -- redundant and error-prone.
**Schema.org first look**: before defining a class, check if schema.org already covers it. Reuse schema.org classes as superclasses or exact equivalents. Reduces duplication and enables structured data consumers (Google, Bing, etc.) to parse artifacts without custom adapters.
**Namespace always**: prefix every local term (prod:Product, not just Product). Bare names cause ambiguity when ontologies are merged or federated.
## Anti-Pattern
1. No disjointness declarations -- reasoner infers unintended class overlaps
2. Object properties without domain/range -- semantic integrity breaks silently
3. No schema.org mapping for common classes -- interoperability lost with zero effort saved
4. SKOS hierarchies without TransitiveProperty on broader -- tree traversal code becomes non-trivial
## Builder Context
This ISO operates within the `ontology-builder` stack, one of 125+ specialized builders
in the CEX architecture. The builder loads ISOs via `cex_skill_loader.py` at pipeline
stage F3 (Compose), merges them with relevant memory from `cex_memory_select.py`,
and produces artifacts that must pass the quality gate at F7 (Filter).
