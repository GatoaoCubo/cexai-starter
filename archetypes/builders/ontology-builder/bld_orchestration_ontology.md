# Collaboration: ontology-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SCHEMA SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "what classes, properties, and axioms define this knowledge domain?"
I do not populate entity instances. I do not write single-term definitions.
I define the CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM so downstream builders (knowledge_graph, rag_source, embedding_config)
have a schema to build against.

## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Knowledge Domain Setup"
```
  1. ontology-builder -> "classification structure: classes, properties, axioms"
  2. glossary-entry-builder -> "human-readable definitions for each class"
  3. knowledge-graph-builder -> "entity instances conforming to ontology schema"
```

### Crew: "RAG Knowledge System"
```
  1. ontology-builder -> "domain taxonomy for chunk categorization"
  2. chunk-strategy-builder -> "how to segment documents by ontology class"
  3. rag-source-builder -> "document corpus with class-annotated chunks"
  4. embedding-config-builder -> "vector config using ontology class namespaces as filters"
  5. retriever-config-builder -> "retrieval pipeline filtered by ontology class"
```

### Crew: "Structured Data Pipeline"
```
  1. ontology-builder -> "schema.org-mapped class hierarchy"
  2. knowledge-graph-builder -> "entity instances for structured data markup"
  3. output-template-builder -> "JSON-LD templates using ontology namespace"
```

## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: domain name, list of candidate classes, primary standard preference
- optional: existing schema.org class names to map to, property requirements, axiom requirements
- context: any existing ontologies in the same domain to extend rather than duplicate

### I Produce
- ontology artifact (.md + compiled .yaml)
- committed to: `P01_knowledge/examples/p01_ont_{name}.md`

### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons listed

## Builders I Depend On
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| guardrail-builder | Security rules for ontology logical consistency may require a guardrail |

## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| knowledge-graph-builder | KG populates entity instances conforming to my class schema |
| glossary-entry-builder | Glossary entries link to my class hierarchy for formal backing |
| rag-source-builder | RAG corpus uses my ontology classes for chunk-level metadata |
| embedding-config-builder | Vector config uses my namespace prefixes as metadata filters |
| retriever-config-builder | Retrieval pipeline uses my class labels as filter dimensions |
| output-template-builder | JSON-LD templates reference my class URIs and namespace |

## Conflict Resolution
| Conflict | Resolution |
|----------|-----------|
| Two ontologies define same class differently | Use earlier version as canonical; extend with subclass in newer version |
| Local class collides with schema.org class | Map local class to schema.org class directly; do not redefine |
| Standard mismatch (OWL vs SKOS requested) | Use `standard: mixed`; annotate each class with its standard origin |
| Domain boundary dispute (medical vs clinical) | Narrow to most specific domain slug; create separate ontology for other domain |
