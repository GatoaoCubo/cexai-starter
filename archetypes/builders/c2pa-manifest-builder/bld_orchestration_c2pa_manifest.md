## Crew Role
Attaches C2PA 2.3 content credentials to AI-generated media, building signed provenance chains that survive distribution and enable content authenticity verification at any downstream point.

## Receives From
| Builder               | What                                  | Format      |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| model-card-builder    | AI model name, version, training info | YAML        |
| vc-credential-builder | Issuer identity credential            | JSON-LD     |
| N02 marketing nucleus | Generated content + prompt text       | Binary/text |
| N03 builder nucleus   | Generation parameters                 | YAML        |

## Produces For
| Builder               | What                                  | Format      |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| Content distribution  | Media file + embedded C2PA manifest   | Binary      |
| CAI verify portal     | Manifest JSON for verification        | JSON        |
| compliance-framework  | Provenance attestation record         | JSON        |
| audit trail           | Signed generation evidence            | JSON        |

## Boundary
Does NOT handle: camera capture manifests (different COSE signing flow), document signing (use separate kind), copyright licensing (use license artifact), or W3C VC agent identity (use vc-credential-builder). C2PA manifest is content-bound, not agent-bound.
