observation: "Tasks without working_memory bounds caused context overflow in 3 multi-step pipeline runs. Tasks with typed slots caught type errors at slot assignment rather than at downstream consumption. clear_on_complete: promote recovered 40% of intermediate discoveries that would have been lost."
pattern: "Always set capacity_limit. Always type context slots. Use clear_on_complete: promote for research tasks, clear for pure computation tasks. expiry: on_task_complete is the safe default."

## Summary
Working memory without capacity limits causes context window overflow in multi-step tasks. Typed slots catch errors early. The clear vs promote decision determines whether task insights survive completion -- for research and analysis tasks, promote is almost always the right choice.

## Pattern
**Typed slots + capacity_limit + expiry: on_task_complete + promote for insights.**
1. Type every slot: int counters, string text state, float scores, bool flags, list accumulators
2. Set capacity_limit before the task starts: estimate peak state size, add 20% buffer
3. expiry: on_task_complete is the safe default; TTL as fallback for stuck tasks
4. clear_on_complete: promote for tasks that discover facts, entities, or patterns
5. promote_targets: entity_memory for facts, episodic_memory for episode summaries, learning_record for patterns

## Anti-Pattern
1. No capacity_limit -- context overflow on long tasks
2. Untyped slots (`data: anything`) -- type errors at consumption time
3. Long-term facts in slots -- lost on clear; put those in entity_memory
4. clear_on_complete: clear for research tasks -- discovered knowledge lost
5. No expiry -- task hangs leave working memory allocated indefinitely
6. Mixing session state in task slots -- session_state has different lifecycle
