# Domain Knowledge: working_memory

## Executive Summary
Working memory (cognitive origin: Baddeley & Hitch, 1974) is the short-term, limited-capacity store for information being actively processed. In LLM agent systems, working memory holds intermediate task state -- current step, accumulated results, error counts -- that a task needs during execution but that does not need to persist after completion. It is the innermost and most ephemeral tier of the P10 memory hierarchy.

## Cognitive Science Foundation
| Cognitive Component | CEX Equivalent | Notes |
|---------------------|---------------|-------|
| Phonological loop | string slots | Verbal/text working state |
| Visuospatial sketchpad | json/list slots | Structured intermediate data |
| Central executive | task_id binding | Task coordination |
| Capacity limit (7+-2 items) | capacity_limit field | Bounded by design |

## LLM Implementation Patterns
| Pattern | Framework | CEX Mapping |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| ConversationBufferWindowMemory | LangChain | context_slots + capacity_limit |
| AgentState dict | LangGraph | context_slots map |
| DSPy Typed Predict state | DSPy | typed context_slots |
| Scratch memory | AutoGPT | working_memory + expiry: on_complete |

## Slot Type Selection
| Task State | Slot Type | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Current processing step | string | "step": "extract_entities" |
| Retry/error counter | int | "retry_count": 2 |
| Intermediate results | list[string] | "results": ["item1", "item2"] |
| Confidence accumulation | float | "avg_confidence": 0.87 |
| Completion flag | bool | "is_complete": false |
| Complex intermediate data | json | "parsed_output": {...} |

## Capacity Guidelines
| Agent Type | Recommended Capacity | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| Simple task agent | 10 slots / 1000 tokens | Low complexity |
| Multi-step pipeline | 20 slots / 4000 tokens | Stage-by-stage accumulation |
| Research agent | 50 slots / 16000 tokens | Extensive intermediate results |

## Clear vs Promote Decision
| Slot Content | Action | Target |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Temporary counters, flags | CLEAR | Discard |
| Discovered entity facts | PROMOTE | entity_memory |
| Task interaction summary | PROMOTE | episodic_memory |
| Error patterns observed | PROMOTE | learning_record |

## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why it fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| No capacity_limit | Context window overflow on long tasks |
| No expiry | Working memory becomes permanent state |
| Long-term facts in slots | Slots cleared on complete; facts lost |
| Mixing session state with task state | Session state belongs in session_state kind |
| Untyped slots | Type errors corrupt task execution |
