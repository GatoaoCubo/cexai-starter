## Observation
Common issues include vague goal definitions leading to ineffective plans, overcomplication with redundant steps, and poor alignment with agent capabilities.

## Pattern
Effective strategies use modular, goal-driven steps with clear success criteria, and prioritize adaptability through conditional branching.

## Evidence
Reviewed artifacts showed higher success rates when plans included explicit constraints and iterative feedback loops.

## Recommendations
- Define specific, measurable objectives before structuring steps.
- Use modular components to enable reuse and adaptability.
- Embed checks for agent capability limits and environmental constraints.
- Prioritize simplicity; avoid over-engineering with unnecessary subtasks.
- Validate plans through simulated edge cases during construction.
