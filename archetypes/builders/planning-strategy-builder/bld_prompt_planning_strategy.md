## Phase 1: RESEARCH  
1. Analyze domain-specific constraints and objectives for the planning strategy.  
2. Identify existing planning frameworks relevant to the agent’s operational environment.  
3. Conduct trade-off analysis between computational efficiency and strategy completeness.  
4. Map agent capabilities to required planning outcomes (e.g., real-time vs. batch processing).  
5. Evaluate historical performance data of similar strategies in analogous scenarios.  
6. Document research findings into a structured requirements matrix.  

## Phase 2: COMPOSE  
1. Outline strategy structure using SCHEMA.md’s hierarchical framework.  
2. Define planning scope (e.g., reactive, deliberative, hybrid) per OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md.  
3. Specify decision-making heuristics and prioritization rules.  
4. Draft step-by-step execution logic with conditional branching.  
5. Integrate domain-specific parameters from research phase into template placeholders.  
6. Align artifact with SCHEMA.md’s required metadata fields (e.g., version, author).  
7. Refine language for clarity and precision, avoiding ambiguous phrasing.  
8. Add example use cases from Phase 1 research to illustrate strategy application.  
9. Perform final syntax check against OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md formatting rules.  

## Phase 3: VALIDATE  
- [ ] ✅ Confirm schema compliance via automated validation tool.  
- [ ] ✅ Verify logical consistency in decision trees and prioritization rules.  
- [ ] ✅ Ensure all research-derived constraints are explicitly addressed.  
- [ ] ✅ Cross-check artifact against OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md for formatting accuracy.  
- [ ] ✅ Obtain stakeholder approval for strategy alignment with operational goals.
