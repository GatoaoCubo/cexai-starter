## Domain Overview  
Planning_strategy defines structured methodologies for agents to sequence actions toward goal achievement in complex environments. It underpins autonomous systems in robotics, logistics, and AI, emphasizing foresight, adaptability, and resource optimization. Unlike workflow execution, planning_strategy focuses on pre-execution decision-making, often involving abstraction, prioritization, and risk mitigation. Key applications include mission planning in aerospace, task scheduling in manufacturing, and pathfinding in autonomous vehicles.  

Modern planning strategies integrate formal models (e.g., PDDL) and heuristic approaches (e.g., A*), balancing computational feasibility with solution quality. They address uncertainty through probabilistic reasoning (e.g., POMDPs) and contingency planning, ensuring robustness in dynamic scenarios. The field evolves with advances in hierarchical planning, multi-agent coordination, and learning-based strategies.

## Industry Standards  
- PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language)  
- STRIPS (Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver)  
- HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) Planning  
- ISO/IEC 23894:2021 (AI Systems – Trustworthiness)  
- AO* (And-Or Graph Algorithm)  
- Kautz & Selman (1992) – "Planning as heuristic search"  

## Common Patterns  
1. **Hierarchical Decomposition** – Break complex goals into manageable subtasks.  
2. **Backward Chaining** – Start from the goal and work backward to identify required actions.  
3. **Heuristic Search** – Use domain-specific knowledge to prioritize promising paths.  
4. **Contingency Embedding** – Pre-define fallback plans for critical failure points.  
5. **Multi-Agent Coordination** – Align plans across autonomous entities with shared objectives.  
6. **Reactive Layer Integration** – Combine proactive planning with real-time adjustments.  

## Pitfalls  
- Over-reliance on heuristics without validation in novel environments.  
- Ignoring computational complexity, leading to intractable plan generation.  
- Failing to model dynamic constraints, causing plans to become obsolete rapidly.  
- Poor abstraction granularity, resulting in either overly simplistic or overly complex strategies.  
- Neglecting resource constraints (time, energy, memory) during plan formulation.
