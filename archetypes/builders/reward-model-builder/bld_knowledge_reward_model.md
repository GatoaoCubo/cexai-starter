## Domain Overview
Reward models are critical in reinforcement learning (RL) for defining agent behavior through quantifiable objectives. They translate abstract goals (e.g., "safety," "efficiency") into numerical signals that guide learning. Proper configuration ensures alignment with downstream tasks, avoids reward hacking, and balances exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. In industry, reward models are pivotal in autonomous systems, robotics, and large language models (LLMs), where misalignment can lead to unsafe or suboptimal outcomes.

Reward model design intersects with safety-critical AI, requiring careful calibration to prevent unintended behaviors. For example, in LLM training, reward models derived from human feedback (e.g., RLHF) must encode nuanced preferences without introducing biases. The configuration process involves defining reward functions, scaling mechanisms, and integration with environment dynamics, often requiring domain-specific expertise.

## Industry Standards
- **RLHF (RL with Human Feedback)**: Framework for aligning models with human preferences (Stiennon et al. 2020)
- **Safe RL** (Leike et al. 2017): Standards for preventing unsafe agent behaviors
- **OpenAI Gym** benchmarks: Standardized environments for reward model evaluation
- **RLlib**: Apache-licensed framework for reward model integration
- **ISO/IEC 23894**: AI ethics guidelines for reward design in safety-critical systems

## Common Patterns
1. Use human feedback to derive reward signals for alignment.
2. Combine sparse task rewards with dense auxiliary signals for stability.
3. Apply reward normalization (e.g., Z-score) to prevent gradient instability.
4. Use discount factors (γ=0.99) to balance long-term vs short-term goals.
5. Introduce safety constraints via penalty terms in reward functions.

## Pitfalls
- Overfitting to narrow reward signals (e.g., ignoring safety).
- Reward hacking via exploitation of poorly defined objectives.
- Ignoring environment dynamics during reward scaling.
- Using unnormalized rewards leading to unstable training.
- Overlooking domain-specific constraints in reward composition.
