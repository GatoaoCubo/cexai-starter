## Phase 1: RESEARCH  
1. Identify regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, AI Act)  
2. Interview stakeholders for safety governance priorities  
3. Analyze historical AI risk incidents in the industry  
4. Benchmark against peer organization policies  
5. Map technical constraints (e.g., model interpretability limits)  
6. Document ethical principles from board-approved frameworks  

## Phase 2: COMPOSE  
1. Define policy scope (e.g., model deployment, data usage)  
2. Structure sections per SCHEMA.md: Purpose, Scope, Rules  
3. Draft CONSTRAIN rules using "shall" and "must" verbs  
4. Align with OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md section headers  
5. Embed technical constraints from Phase 1 research  
6. Reference applicable regulations in compliance section  
7. Add audit trail requirements for policy violations  
8. Include escalation procedures for safety breaches  
9. Finalize language using plain English and active voice  

## Phase 3: VALIDATE  
- [ ] ✅ Validate schema compliance with SCHEMA.md  
- [ ] ✅ Confirm stakeholder sign-off on v1.0 draft  
- [ ] ✅ Test policy against 3 hypothetical risk scenarios  
- [ ] ✅ Verify legal team approval for regulatory alignment  
- [ ] ✅ Obtain CISO endorsement for technical feasibility
