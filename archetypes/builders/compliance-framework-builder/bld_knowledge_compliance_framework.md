## Domain Overview
Regulatory compliance for AI systems involves aligning technical implementations with legal requirements across jurisdictions. As AI adoption grows, regulators like the EU (AI Act), US (FDA, FTC), and global bodies (OECD) mandate transparency, fairness, and accountability. Compliance frameworks must map AI system capabilities (e.g., data processing, decision-making) to specific regulatory obligations, ensuring traceability from design to deployment. Challenges include overlapping regulations, dynamic policy updates, and verifying compliance across distributed AI workflows.

## Key Concepts
| Concept               | Definition                                                                 | Source                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Regulatory Scope     | Legal boundaries defining AI system obligations (e.g., data privacy, bias) | GDPR, AI Act                   |
| Attestation          | Formal verification that AI systems meet regulatory requirements           | NIST AI RMF                    |
| Compliance Mapping   | Linking AI components to applicable laws/standards                        | ISO/IEC 42001                  |
| Jurisdictional Overlap | Conflicts or redundancies across regional regulations                   | OECD AI Principles             |
| Accountability Trail | Auditable record of AI decisions and compliance checks                    | FAT\* Conference Papers        |
| Risk-Based Compliance | Prioritizing regulations based on AI system impact (e.g., high-risk vs. low-risk) | NIST SP 800-188                |
| Dynamic Policy Alignment | Mechanisms to update compliance frameworks as regulations evolve       | IEEE Ethically Aligned Design  |
| Third-Party Validation | Independent verification of compliance by auditors or regulators         | ISO/IEC 23894                  |

## Industry Standards
- GDPR (EU data protection)
- AI Act (EU regulatory framework)
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework
- OECD AI Principles
- ISO/IEC 42001 (AI management systems)
- IEEE Ethically Aligned Design
- FDA’s AI/ML-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) guidance

## Common Patterns
1. Map AI system modules to regulatory clauses using taxonomies (e.g., data flow → GDPR Article 30).
2. Use attestation reports for third-party audits and stakeholder transparency.
3. Embed compliance checks into CI/CD pipelines for real-time policy alignment.
4. Maintain version-controlled regulatory mappings to track changes over time.
5. Leverage standardized templates (e.g., NIST RMF) for consistent attestation.

## Pitfalls
- Overlooking jurisdictional nuances (e.g., conflicting data localization rules).
- Relying on static compliance checks without continuous monitoring.
- Failing to involve legal experts in early AI design stages.
- Using vague metrics (e.g., “fairness” without defined benchmarks).
- Ignoring updates to regulations, leading to outdated compliance frameworks.
