## Quality Gate

## Definition
| metric | threshold | operator | scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Regulatory Compliance Coverage | 100% | ≥ | All AI systems |

## HARD Gates
| ID | Check | Fail Condition |
|---|---|---|
| H01 | YAML valid | Invalid YAML syntax |
| H02 | ID matches pattern | ID does not match `^p11_cfw_[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$` |
| H03 | kind matches | `kind` ≠ `compliance_framework` |
| H04 | Regulatory frameworks mapped | No specific regulation (GDPR/AI Act/NIST/ISO42001) cited by name and article |
| H05 | Attestation provided | Missing signed attestation with date and compliance officer name |
| H06 | Gap analysis present | No gap analysis section or all gaps marked as N/A without justification |
| H07 | Regulatory mapping table | No table linking system components to regulation articles |
| H08 | Data privacy provisions | Missing GDPR/CCPA/LGPD data subject rights section when personal data processed |
| H09 | Bias mitigation evidence | No bias audit or fairness metric when AI Act Art. 10 applies |
| H10 | Version control | No version history for regulatory mappings |

## SOFT Scoring
| Dim | Dimension | Weight | Scoring Guide |
|---|---|---|---|
| D01 | Regulatory completeness | 0.20 | 0.9–1.0: Full coverage |
| D02 | Attestation quality | 0.15 | 0.8–0.9: Valid but incomplete |
| D03 | Documentation | 0.15 | 0.7–0.8: Partial documentation |
| D04 | Third-party audit | 0.10 | 0.6–0.7: Pending audit |
| D05 | Data privacy | 0.10 | 0.5–0.6: Minor gaps |
| D06 | Bias mitigation | 0.10 | 0.4–0.5: Basic plan |
| D07 | Version control | 0.10 | 0.3–0.4: No history |
| D08 | Stakeholder feedback | 0.10 | 0.2–0.3: Unreviewed |

## Actions
| Score | Action |
|---|---|
| ≥9.5 | Automatically approve and publish |
| ≥8.0 | Publish with minimal review |
| ≥7.0 | Request review by compliance team |
| <7.0 | Reject and require fixes |

## Bypass
| conditions | approver | audit trail |
|---|---|---|
| Critical regulatory change | CTO | Log bypass reason and approver |
| Emergency deployment | CEO | Include timestamp and justification |
| Legal exemption confirmed | Legal Counsel | Attach exemption documentation |

## Examples

## Golden Example
```markdown
---
title: AI Compliance Framework for EU AI Act & GDPR
version: 1.0
author: Compliance Team
date: 2023-10-01
regulatory_scope: [EU AI Act, GDPR, CCPA]
---

### Regulatory Mapping
- **EU AI Act (Art. 13):** High-risk AI systems require transparency in data processing.
  → Mapped to: Data logging module (v1.2), user consent dashboard.
- **GDPR (Art. 22):** Right to object to automated decision-making.
  → Mapped to: Manual override switch in scoring algorithms.
- **CCPA (§ 999.313):** Consumer right to access data used for AI training.
  → Mapped to: Data export API endpoint (v2.1).

### Attestation
> This system complies with mapped regulations as of 2023-10-01.
> Signed by: [Compliance Officer Name], [Date]
```

## Anti-Example 1: Missing Regulatory Scope
```markdown
---
title: AI Compliance Framework
version: 0.5
author: Dev Team
date: 2023-09-15
---

### Regulatory Mapping
- "Data must be encrypted": Implemented via AES-256.
- "User consent required": Handled by checkbox on signup.
```
## Why it fails
No explicit regulatory scope (e.g., GDPR, EU AI Act) is defined. The framework lacks traceability to specific laws, making it impossible to verify compliance or update with new regulations.

## Anti-Example 2: Conflating with Safety Policies
```markdown
---
title: AI Safety & Compliance Framework
version: 1.0
author: Ops Team
date: 2023-10-05
regulatory_scope: [Internal Safety Policy]
---

### Regulatory Mapping
- "No unattended AI deployment": Requires 24/7 monitoring.
- "Annual risk assessment": Conducted by Q4 each year.
```
## Why it fails
The framework conflates regulatory compliance with internal safety policies (not laws). It violates the boundary by focusing on organizational rules rather than external regulatory requirements.

### H_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (HARD)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (min 3 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream or sibling reference
- Gate: REJECT if < 3 entries (auto-populated by cex_wikilink.py at F6.5)

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
