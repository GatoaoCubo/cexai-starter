## Domain Overview
Referral programs are critical growth mechanisms in SaaS, fintech, and consumer apps, leveraging user networks to drive acquisition. A key metric is the *viral coefficient* (K), which measures the average number of new users generated per existing user. When K > 1, growth becomes self-sustaining. Reward structures must balance incentive alignment, user motivation, and business cost, often using tiered rewards, discounts, or exclusive perks.

Designing effective referral loops requires understanding user behavior, such as the *critical mass* threshold for virality and the *activation rate* of referred users. Programs must also mitigate fraud, ensure compliance with privacy laws (e.g., CCPA), and integrate with analytics tools to track conversion funnels and ROI.

| Critical Mass         | Minimum user base required for virality to outpace churn                 | Anderson, *Viral Loops* (2016)                                        |

## Industry Standards
- *Viral Coefficient Formula* (Anderson, 2014)
- *Growth-Driven Design* framework (Marcus Lemonis, 2020)
- *Referral Economics* (Gupta & Lehmann, 2018)
- *Hook Model* (Eyal, 2014)
- *HBR Article: "The Power of Referral"* (2020)
- *RFC 8288: Internet Standards Track* (IETF, 2018) – for API design in referral systems

## Common Patterns
1. Tiered rewards for multiple referrals
2. Immediate rewards for referrer, deferred for referee
3. Social proof badges (e.g., "Top Referrer")
4. Gamification via leaderboards
5. Multi-channel referral (email, in-app, SMS)

## Pitfalls
- Over-reliance on K without measuring activation rates
- Rewards that incentivize spamming over quality referrals
- Ignoring churn in viral coefficient calculations
- Lack of fraud detection for fake referrals
- Overcomplicating reward structures, reducing adoption
