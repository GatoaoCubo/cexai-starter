## Domain Overview  
Open source contributor guides standardize onboarding processes, ensuring consistency in code quality, collaboration, and legal compliance. They serve as critical artifacts for projects adopting meritocratic governance, enabling scalable community contributions. Key components include development environment setup, pull request (PR) workflows, coding conventions, peer review protocols, and legal agreements like Contributor License Agreements (CLAs). These guides align with industry practices such as the Linux Kernel’s documentation rigor and Apache Software Foundation’s contribution policies, balancing developer autonomy with project governance.  

## Key Concepts  
| Concept               | Definition                                                                 | Source                                  |  
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|  
| CLA                 | Legal agreement granting project rights to contributed code                | Apache Software Foundation             |  
| PR Workflow         | Process for proposing, reviewing, and merging changes via platforms like GitHub | GitHub Docs                            |  
| Coding Standards    | Rules for code style, structure, and readability (e.g., PEP8, Google Java Style) | Google Open Source                     |  
| Code Review         | Peer evaluation of code changes for correctness, security, and maintainability | Google’s Code Review Guide             |  
| DCO                 | Developer attestation that contributions are authorized and comply with licensing | Linux Kernel RFC 7839                  |  
| CI/CD Pipeline      | Automated testing and integration workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI) | GitHub Docs                            |  
| Branching Strategy  | Git workflow model (e.g., GitFlow, Trunk-Based Development)                 | Vincent Driessen (GitFlow)             |  
| Issue Tracking      | Systematic approach to logging, prioritizing, and resolving bugs/features  | Jira Software                          |  
| Semantic Versioning | Versioning scheme (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for backward compatibility           | Semantic Versioning 2.0.0              |  
| Linter              | Tool enforcing coding standards (e.g., ESLint, RuboCop)                    | ESLint Docs                            |  

## Industry Standards  
- Apache Software Foundation CLA  
- GitHub Pull Request and Merge Request workflows  
- Google Open Source Coding Standards  
- RFC 7839 (Developer Certificate of Origin)  
- Semantic Versioning 2.0.0  
- GitFlow branching model (Vincent Driessen)  
- Jira Issue Tracking Framework  
- Dependabot for dependency updates  
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality  

## Common Patterns  
1. Use Docker for reproducible dev environments  
2. Enforce GitFlow for feature branch management  
3. Require PR templates with issue references  
4. Automate CI/CD checks for linting and tests  
5. Use checklists for code review completeness  
6. Mandate DCO signing for all commits  

## Pitfalls  
- Skipping CLA/DCO requirements leading to legal risks  
- Inconsistent coding standards causing merge conflicts  
- Force-pushing to main branch disrupting history  
- Ignoring review feedback without explanation  
- Poor PR descriptions lacking context or scope
