## Examples

## Golden Example
```markdown
---
title: "Graph RAG Configuration for Legal Document Analysis"
kind: graph_rag_config
---
**Graph Database**: Neo4j (version 5.19.0)
**Vector Store**: Pinecone (index: "legal-docs-2024")
**RAG Components**:
- **LLM**: GPT-4 (OpenAI) for query refinement and answer generation
- **Graph Traversal**: BFS with depth limit 3 for entity relationship exploration
- **Node Types**:
  - `Case`: Properties include `case_id`, `court`, `date`
  - `Entity`: Properties include `name`, `type` (person, organization)
  - `Citation`: Links `Case` nodes via `CITES` relationships
**Edge Types**:
- `RELATED_TO`: Connects entities mentioned in the same document
- `REFERRED_IN`: Links cases to cited legal precedents
**Query Flow**:
1. User input → 2. Vector search in Pinecone → 3. Graph traversal → 4. LLM answer synthesis
**Traversal Constraints**:
- Max hops: 3
- Filter: Only include nodes with `relevance_score > 0.7`
```

## Anti-Example 1: Confusing config with knowledge graph data
```markdown
---
title: "Legal Knowledge Graph"
kind: graph_rag_config
---
**Nodes**:
- `Case_1234`: {court: "Supreme Court", date: "2022-05-15"}
- `Entity_5678`: {name: "John Doe", type: "person"}
**Edges**:
- `Case_1234` --[CITES]--> `Case_9876`
## Why it fails
This example describes actual graph data (nodes/edges) instead of the architecture configuration. It violates the boundary by acting as a knowledge graph instance rather than defining how the RAG system interacts with the graph.
```

## Anti-Example 2: Missing critical components
```markdown
---
title: "Minimal Graph RAG Setup"
kind: graph_rag_config
---
**Graph Database**: Neo4j
**Vector Store**: Not specified
**Traversal**: DFS without depth limits
## Why it fails
The configuration omits essential components like the vector store integration and lacks explicit RAG pipeline details. Without a defined vector store and traversal constraints, the system cannot effectively retrieve or synthesize answers from the graph.

### H_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (HARD)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (min 3 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream or sibling reference
- Gate: REJECT if < 3 entries (auto-populated by cex_wikilink.py at F6.5)

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
