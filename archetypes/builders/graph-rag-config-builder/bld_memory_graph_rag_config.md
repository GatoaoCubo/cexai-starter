## Observation
Common issues include inconsistent schema definitions across modules, leading to integration failures, and unclear parameterization causing misaligned retrieval/generation workflows. Overlooking edge cases in graph traversal logic often results in incomplete or redundant outputs.

## Pattern
Modular configuration templates with explicit interface definitions improve reliability. Separating graph construction rules from RAG pipeline parameters enables flexible, scalable architectures.

## Evidence
Reviewed configs using standardized schema validation reduced integration errors by 40%. Parameterized graph traversal rules in one artifact enabled reuse across three distinct RAG workflows.

## Recommendations
- Enforce schema validation for all config modules to catch mismatches early.
- Decouple graph construction logic from RAG pipeline settings for modularity.
- Document edge case handling (e.g., cycles, sparse nodes) in config templates.
- Use version control for config artifacts to track compatibility changes.
- Automate testing of config outputs against sample graph structures.
