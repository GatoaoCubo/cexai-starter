## Phase 1: RESEARCH (case study discovery)
1. Confirm customer champion participation and quote approval rights.
2. Collect customer context: company size, industry, geography, persona (e.g., CTO, VP Sales).
3. Document the challenge: pain point, business impact, timeline (before state).
4. Gather solution details: product features used, implementation timeline, integrations.
5. Quantify outcomes: ROI percentage, cost savings, time-to-value, efficiency gains (after state).
6. Record direct pullquote from champion (50-80 words, attributable to name + title).
7. Validate all metrics against customer-approved data (no unverified statistics).

## Phase 2: COMPOSE
1. Structure per bld_schema_case_study.md Challenge -> Solution -> Outcome arc.
2. Write Challenge section (150-200 words): before-state, pain context, business stakes.
3. Write Solution section: named product features, deployment timeline, key integrations.
4. Write Outcome section: 3+ KPIs with before/after comparison (e.g., "30% downtime -> 2%").
5. Insert pullquote block per bld_output_template_case_study.md designated block.
6. Add ROI call-out box: headline metric, timeframe, verified source.
7. Add company sidebar: industry, size, region, champion name and title.
8. Write "Lessons Learned" closing (50-100 words) with transferable insight.
9. Edit for plain language: replace jargon with contextual terms.
