## Domain Overview
Customer case studies are narrative evidence artifacts that demonstrate product value through verified customer outcomes. The industry standard structure is Challenge-Solution-Outcome (CSO): start with the before-state pain, describe the solution adopted, quantify the after-state result. High-credibility case studies include a named champion pullquote, a ROI call-out with headline metric, and before/after KPI comparison tables.

Industry references: Gartner customer reference program requires verified ROI figures and champion sign-off. AWS case study template uses the CSO structure with company snapshot sidebar. Snowflake customer stories include a KPI comparison table as first visual element. G2 requires quote attribution to a named person with verifiable title.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Definition | Source |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Challenge-Solution-Outcome | Three-act narrative structure: before-state, intervention, after-state | Harvard Business Review case method |
| Champion pullquote | Direct quote from a named, titled customer contact approving publication | G2 testimonial standards |
| ROI call-out | Headline metric (e.g., "85% cost reduction") with timeframe and verified source | Gartner customer reference guidelines |
| Before/after KPI table | Quantitative comparison of 3+ metrics pre- and post-implementation | AWS case study template |
| Company snapshot sidebar | Context block: industry, company size, region, champion name/title | Snowflake customer stories format |
| Lessons Learned | Transferable insight closing section; prevents the case study from being purely promotional | HBR case method |
| Customer champion | Internal sponsor who approves content, provides quotes, and validates metrics | Gartner customer reference program |
| Outcome verification | Process of confirming all stated metrics with customer-provided data | G2 verification guidelines |

## Industry Standards
- Gartner customer reference program (enterprise ROI verification and champion sign-off)
- AWS case study template (Challenge/Solution/Result with company snapshot)
- Snowflake customer stories (KPI table as primary evidence element)
- G2 testimonial guidelines (named attribution, title verification, no promotional language)
- Harvard Business Review case method (Challenge-Solution-Outcome narrative arc)
- IDC business value methodology (ROI quantification with before/after comparison)

## Common Patterns
1. Challenge-first: open with pain to hook the reader before mentioning the product.
2. Before/after contrast: every KPI has a baseline (before) and a result (after) with % delta.
3. Named pullquote block: 50-80 words, emotionally resonant, tied to the outcome section.
4. ROI call-out box: headline number, timeframe, source -- the "shareable stat" for marketing.
5. Company snapshot: anchors the story in industry context (size, region, persona).
6. Lessons Learned closing: 50-100 words with a transferable insight beyond this customer.

## Pitfalls
- Anonymous quotes: "A customer said..." invalidates credibility (G2 rejects these).
- Unverified metrics: stating "50% cost reduction" without customer sign-off is a liability.
- Solution-first narrative: starting with features before establishing the pain loses readers.
- Vague KPIs: "improved efficiency" without a baseline number is not a case study, it is a testimonial.
- Missing ROI call-out: the shareable stat is what sales teams cite in decks; its absence is felt.
- Fabricated context: using fictional company names or placeholder metrics (ProviderA, 30%) invalidates trust.
