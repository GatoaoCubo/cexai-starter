## Examples

## Golden Example
```markdown

kind: partner_listing
title: Cisco Systems Inc. Partner Listing
---
**Partner Name**: Cisco Systems Inc.
**Tier**: Platinum
**Region**: North America
**Certifications**:
- Cisco Certified Partner (CCP)
- Cisco Partner Advantage (CPA)
**Contact**:
- Email: partners@cisco.com
- Phone: +1 800 553 2447
**Description**: Cisco Systems Inc. is a global leader in networking and IT solutions, offering enterprise-grade hardware, software, and services. As a Platinum partner, they provide advanced consulting, deployment, and support services for Cisco products across North America.
```

## Anti-Example 1: Missing Key Fields
```markdown
---
kind: partner_listing
title: TechSolutions Inc. Listing
---
**Partner Name**: TechSolutions Inc.
**Region**: Europe
**Certifications**:
- ISO 9001
**Contact**:
- Email: contact@techsolutions.com
```
## Why it fails:
Omits **tier** (critical for partner categorization) and lacks **specific certifications** relevant to the partner's domain (e.g., IT, cloud, etc.), making the listing incomplete and unactionable for potential collaborators.

## Anti-Example 2: Case Study Confusion
```markdown
---
kind: partner_listing
title: How ABC Corp Boosted Efficiency with XYZ Tools
---
**Customer**: ABC Corp
**Solution**: XYZ Tools' AI-driven analytics platform
**Outcome**: 30% faster processing times
**Contact**: sales@xyztools.com
```
## Why it fails:
This is a **case study**, not a partner listing. It focuses on a customer's success story rather than detailing the partner's **tier, region, certifications**, or direct contact methods for collaboration.

### H_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (HARD)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (min 3 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream or sibling reference
- Gate: REJECT if < 3 entries (auto-populated by cex_wikilink.py at F6.5)

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
