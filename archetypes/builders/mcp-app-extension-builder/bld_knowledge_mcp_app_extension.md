## Domain Overview
mcp_app_extension artifacts declare interactive UI apps that plug into MCP clients (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI ChatGPT) under SEP-1865, the Apps Extension proposal co-developed by Anthropic and OpenAI and governed by the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF, Linux Foundation). They build on top of the Model Context Protocol spec 2025-11-25: where a plain mcp_server exposes tools and resources over JSON-RPC, an mcp_app_extension adds a packaged HTML UI rendered inside a sandboxed iframe by the client.

An extension is a bundle of: an app-manifest (metadata + capabilities + permissions), an install handshake (manifest fetch, signature validation, sandbox provisioning), a launch flow (iframe spawn with session token via postMessage), and a terminate flow (token revocation, sandbox teardown). The app can only call MCP tools/resources listed in its capabilities, and can only use host APIs inside its permission grants.

## Industry Standards
- MCP spec 2025-11-25 (base protocol, Anthropic-originated, AAIF-governed)
- SEP-1865 draft 2026 (Apps Extension, Anthropic + OpenAI co-authored)
- HTML Living Standard (iframe sandbox attribute semantics)
- Content Security Policy Level 3 (CSP for iframe isolation)
- postMessage API (cross-origin channel, MDN and WHATWG references)
- OAuth 2.0 session tokens (where reused for launch handshake)

## Common Patterns
1. Treat entry_url as immutable per app_id + version tuple; bump version to change UI.
2. Enumerate capabilities against the backing mcp_server's advertised tools/resources; no wildcards.
3. Justify every permission inline; Anthropic and OpenAI reviewers reject unjustified scopes.
4. Use CSP `frame-ancestors` to pin the allowed MCP client origins.
5. Define postMessage payload schemas for install, launch, terminate so clients can validate them.
6. Keep the UI stateless where possible; persist via MCP resources, not sandbox storage.

## Pitfalls
- Confusing mcp_app_extension with plain mcp_server (the latter has no UI; the former requires iframe).
- Confusing it with a browser extension (Chrome Web Store); browser extensions run in the browser, not in an MCP client sandbox.
- Requesting broad permissions (e.g., `network:*`) that fail AAIF review.
- Using `allow-same-origin` without a documented justification.
- Omitting the terminate handler, leaking sandbox state and session tokens.
- Treating the parent-frame DOM as reachable; the sandbox forbids it and the client will block postMessage attempts that imply such access.
