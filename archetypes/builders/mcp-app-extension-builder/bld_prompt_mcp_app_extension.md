## Phase 1: RESEARCH
1. Read the latest SEP-1865 draft (Anthropic + OpenAI, AAIF Linux Foundation track).
2. Confirm compatibility with the MCP base spec 2025-11-25.
3. List MCP tools and resources the app needs; map each to a capability declaration.
4. Enumerate permission scopes required (file-access, network, clipboard, camera) and justify each.
5. Identify the target MCP clients (Claude Desktop, ChatGPT desktop, third-party) and their sandbox policies.
6. Audit for overlap with plain mcp_server kind -- if there is no iframe UI, this is NOT an app extension.

## Phase 2: COMPOSE
1. Reference SCHEMA.md for required manifest fields (app_id, version, entry_url, capabilities, permissions).
2. Populate OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md using validated manifest data.
3. Set app_id using the pattern `^p04_mae_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$` with no dots.
4. Set entry_url to an HTTPS URL that the MCP client will load inside a sandboxed iframe.
5. List capabilities as an array of MCP tool or resource names the app may invoke.
6. List permissions as explicit scope strings; NEVER request permissions the app does not use.
7. Document install, launch, and terminate handlers with postMessage payload shapes.
8. Declare a Content Security Policy (CSP) that forbids parent-frame DOM access.
9. Proofread against SEP-1865 examples (Anthropic MCP docs) for conformance.

## Phase 3: VALIDATE
- [ ] All required manifest fields present (app_id, version, entry_url, capabilities, permissions).
- [ ] app_id matches the p04_mae_ pattern; no dots, lowercase only.
- [ ] entry_url is HTTPS and reachable.
- [ ] Each capability maps to a real MCP tool or resource in the server contract.
- [ ] Every permission has a written justification; no unused scopes.
- [ ] Install, launch, terminate flows documented with postMessage schemas.
- [ ] Sandbox CSP excludes parent-frame DOM, eval, and inline scripts.
