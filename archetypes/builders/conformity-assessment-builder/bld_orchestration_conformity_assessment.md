# Conformity Assessment Builder -- Collaboration

## Crew Role

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Role in crew | EU AI Act Annex-IV technical documentation producer |
| Nucleus | N03 (Builder) |
| Triggers | Dispatch from N07 with conformity_assessment intent |
| Output | Complete Annex-IV package as conformity_assessment artifact |
| Signal | write_signal('n03', 'complete', score) on F8 |

## Receives From

| Source | Artifact/Data | Format | Required? |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Legal team / user | System requirements and compliance brief | JSON or free-text | MANDATORY |
| N01 Intelligence | EU AI Act research KCs (kc_eu_ai_act_*.md) | .md knowledge cards | STRONGLY RECOMMENDED |
| N05 Operations | System audit logs, accuracy test results, pentest summary | .md or .csv | MANDATORY (for accuracy/cybersecurity) |
| N06 Commercial | Budget context for compliance investment | Handoff note | OPTIONAL |
| User / provider | Provider name, address, contact | Form fields | MANDATORY |
| User / provider | Annex III category determination | Enum value | MANDATORY (or derived by builder) |

## Produces For

| Consumer | Artifact | Format | When |
|----------|---------|--------|------|
| Legal team | Annex-IV conformity package | p11_ca_[system].md | On F8 complete |
| N06 Commercial | Compliance cost estimates input | Signal note in handoff | On F8 complete |
| N04 Knowledge | Conformity KC for library | Pointer to artifact | On F8 complete |
| N07 Orchestrator | Completion signal | write_signal + quality score | On F8 complete |
| Registry | Compiled YAML | _tools/cex_compile.py output | On F8 compile step |

## Handoff Contract

### Incoming Handoff (what N07 writes to trigger this builder)

```markdown
## Task
Produce a conformity_assessment artifact for [SYSTEM_NAME] v[VERSION].

## Context
- Annex III category: [CATEGORY]
- Article 43 procedure: [internal_check or notified_body]
- Provider: [PROVIDER_NAME], [ADDRESS]
- Technical doc reference: [REF]

## Relevant artifacts (READ before producing)
1. archetypes/builders/conformity-assessment-builder/ (13 ISOs)
2. P01_knowledge/library/kind/kc_conformity_assessment.md
3. N01_intelligence/ (any EU AI Act KCs)
4. N05_operations/ (audit logs, accuracy test results for this system)

## Expected output
1. File: P11_govern/p11_ca_[system_slug].md
2. Kind: conformity_assessment
3. Quality gate: H01-H08 all pass, score >= 9.0
4. Signal: write_signal('n03', 'complete', score)
5. Stage: git add P11_govern/p11_ca_[system_slug].md
6. Commit: git commit -m "[N03] conformity_assessment: [system_name]"

## Aug-2026 context
Flag all mandatory items with [AUG-2026-DEADLINE].
If declaration_date > 2026-08-01, add warning.
```

### Outgoing Signal (what this builder writes on completion)

```python
from _tools.signal_writer import write_signal
write_signal('n03', 'complete', 9.2)
# Payload includes: artifact_path, system_name, annex_iii_category, score, gates_passed
```

## Boundary Conditions

### IN SCOPE (this builder handles)

| Scope Item | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Annex-IV package production | All 7 sections per Art. 11 |
| RMS documentation | Per Art. 9 -- identification, estimation, mitigation |
| Data-governance documentation | Per Art. 10 -- training, validation, bias, provenance |
| Human-oversight documentation | Per Art. 14 -- override, interpretability, training |
| Post-market-monitoring plan | Per Art. 72 -- KPIs, collection, SIR procedure |
| Annex-III category identification | Based on user input or derivation from system description |

### OUT OF SCOPE (route elsewhere)

| Out of Scope | Route To |
|-------------|----------|
| CE marking physical affixing | Legal + notified body |
| EU Declaration of Conformity (Art. 47 DoC) | Legal team |
| GDPR compliance | DPO / legal |
| ISO 42001 certification | Quality management |
| Non-high-risk AI systems | Not applicable |
| General-purpose AI (GPAI, Chapter V) | GPAI procedure |

## Escalation Protocol

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Annex III category ambiguous | Ask user one clarifying question; do not guess |
| Notified body ID not provided but required | Block output at H02/H03; request NB ID |
| RMS evidence missing (no risk register) | Include empty table with [EVIDENCE REQUIRED] flags; do not fabricate |
| PMM plan impossible (pre-deployment system) | Note "PMM plan will be established at deployment"; flag [AUG-2026-DEADLINE] |
| System not in Annex III | Stop builder; inform user this is not a high-risk system per Annex III |
| Score < 8.0 after two F6 retries | Flag for N07 review; output current draft with DRAFT watermark |
