# Conformity Assessment Builder -- Architecture

## Component Inventory (13 ISOs)

| # | ISO File | Kind | Pillar | LLM Function | Role in Pipeline |
|---|----------|------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | bld_manifest_conformity_assessment.md | type_builder | P11 | BECOME | Activates builder identity, routing, capabilities |
| 2 | bld_instruction_conformity_assessment.md | instruction | P03 | REASON | Drives F1-F8 execution steps; 3-phase protocol |
| 3 | bld_system_prompt_conformity_assessment.md | system_prompt | P03 | BECOME | Sets identity, scope, ALWAYS/NEVER rules |
| 4 | bld_schema_conformity_assessment.md | schema | P06 | CONSTRAIN | Field definitions, types, validation rules |
| 5 | bld_quality_gate_conformity_assessment.md | quality_gate | P11 | GOVERN | H01-H08 hard gates + D01-D05 soft scoring |
| 6 | bld_output_template_conformity_assessment.md | output_template | P05 | PRODUCE | Fill-in-the-blanks Annex-IV template |
| 7 | bld_examples_conformity_assessment.md | examples | P07 | GOVERN | Golden example (MedTriage) + 2 anti-examples |
| 8 | bld_knowledge_card_conformity_assessment.md | knowledge_card | P01 | INJECT | EU AI Act domain knowledge, Annex III map |
| 9 | bld_architecture_conformity_assessment.md | architecture | P08 | CONSTRAIN | This file -- component map and dependencies |
| 10 | bld_collaboration_conformity_assessment.md | collaboration | P12 | COLLABORATE | Crew interfaces, handoffs, boundary conditions |
| 11 | bld_config_conformity_assessment.md | config | P09 | CONSTRAIN | Naming conventions, paths, limits, hooks |
| 12 | bld_memory_conformity_assessment.md | learning_record | P10 | INJECT | Observed pitfalls, patterns, evidence from prior runs |
| 13 | bld_tools_conformity_assessment.md | tools | P04 | CALL | Production, validation, and external reference tools |

## 8F Pipeline Mapping

| 8F Stage | ISOs Active | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| F1 CONSTRAIN | manifest, schema, config, architecture | Resolve kind, pillar, naming, field constraints |
| F2 BECOME | manifest, system_prompt | Activate specialist identity and scope rules |
| F3 INJECT | knowledge_card, memory, examples | Load EU AI Act domain knowledge and learned patterns |
| F4 REASON | instruction | Drive 3-phase protocol: RESEARCH, COMPOSE, VALIDATE |
| F5 CALL | tools | Execute cex_compile, cex_score, cex_doctor; check schema |
| F6 PRODUCE | output_template, instruction | Generate Annex-IV artifact using template + research |
| F7 GOVERN | quality_gate, examples | Apply H01-H08 gates and D01-D05 scoring; compare to examples |
| F8 COLLABORATE | collaboration, tools | Save, compile, commit, signal; deliver to crew partners |

## Dependency Graph

```
manifest ------> system_prompt (activates)
manifest ------> collaboration (routing triggers)
schema ---------> quality_gate (field counts for H-gates)
schema ---------> output_template (field placeholders)
knowledge_card -> instruction (domain terms)
knowledge_card -> examples (regulatory basis for examples)
instruction ----> output_template (which sections to populate)
examples -------> quality_gate (D-score calibration)
memory ---------> instruction (learned pitfall avoidance)
config ---------> schema (naming pattern)
config ---------> tools (path config for compile/score)
tools ----------> quality_gate (score execution)
architecture ---> collaboration (component interfaces)
```

## File Naming Architecture

| Pattern | Example | Used For |
|---------|---------|---------|
| p11_ca_[system].md | p11_ca_medtriage_v2.md | Conformity assessment artifacts |
| bld_[iso]_conformity_assessment.md | bld_manifest_conformity_assessment.md | Builder ISOs (this directory) |
| p11_ca_[system]_annex_iv.pdf | p11_ca_medtriage_v2_annex_iv.pdf | Export package (out of scope for builder) |
