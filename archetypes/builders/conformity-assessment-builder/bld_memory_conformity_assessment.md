# Conformity Assessment Builder -- Memory
## Learning Record Type
This is a `correction` + `convention` memory artifact.
It records lessons from prior conformity assessment build cycles to prevent recurrence.
Injected at F3 INJECT to inform F4 REASON and F6 PRODUCE.

## Observations (What the Builder Has Learned)
### O-001: RMS Is the Most Common Failure Point
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Observation | The risk-management-system section fails H04 gate more than any other section |
| Frequency | ~40% of first-pass builds |
| Root cause | Builders treat RMS as a narrative ("we manage risks") not a structured process with named risks, IDs, and controls |
| Evidence | Anti-example 1 in bld_examples_conformity_assessment.md |
### O-002: DoC vs. Annex IV Confusion Is Endemic
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Observation | ~25% of builds confuse the Declaration of Conformity (Art. 47) with the Annex-IV package |
| Root cause | Both are "conformity" documents; the boundary is rarely explained |
| Evidence | Anti-example 2 in bld_examples_conformity_assessment.md |
| Rule derived | System prompt rule: "NEVER conflate the conformity assessment package with the EU Declaration of Conformity document" |
### O-003: Aug-2026 Deadline Often Not Flagged
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Observation | When deadlines are not surfaced in output, legal teams miss them in review |
| Root cause | Builders treat the deadline as background context, not a required output element |
| Rule derived | Flag all mandatory Annex-IV items with [AUG-2026-DEADLINE] regardless of declaration_date |
### O-004: PMM Plans Are Frequently Omitted

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Observation | Post-market-monitoring (Art. 72) is often absent or one sentence |
| Root cause | Art. 72 is in Chapter VI of the Act; builders focus on Chapter III (high-risk requirements) |
| Fix | H08 gate explicitly checks PMM; instruction Phase 1.5 mandates PMM data collection |

### O-005: Data Governance Conflated with GDPR

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Observation | ~15% of builds include GDPR data subject rights in the data-governance section |
| Root cause | "Data governance" is used in both GDPR and EU AI Act contexts |
| Rule derived | EU AI Act Art. 10 data governance = training data quality, bias, provenance. NOT GDPR |
| Boundary | GDPR is out of scope for this builder -- route to DPO |

### O-006: Notified Body Requirement Missed for Biometric ID

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Observation | Builders select "internal_check" for real-time remote biometric identification systems |
| Root cause | Article 43(1)(a) exception is not well-known |
| Rule derived | REQUIRE_NB_FOR_BIOMETRIC config flag is true by default; H07 gate checks category |
| Evidence | Annex III(1)(a): real-time remote biometric ID in public spaces requires notified body |

### O-007: Accuracy Metrics Without Test Dataset Reference

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Observation | Accuracy claims like "95% accuracy" with no dataset reference fail D03 (evidence density) |
| Root cause | Builders copy accuracy from system specs without adding evaluation context |
| Rule derived | Every accuracy metric MUST include: metric name, threshold, achieved value, AND test dataset name |

## Pitfalls (Anti-Patterns to Avoid)

| ID | Pitfall | Prevention |
|----|---------|-----------|
| P-001 | Writing RMS as narrative prose | Use structured table: Risk ID, description, severity, likelihood, mitigation, residual |
| P-002 | Omitting notified body ID for biometric ID systems | Check REQUIRE_NB_FOR_BIOMETRIC flag; enforce at H02 |
| P-003 | Including GDPR in the Annex IV package | Explicitly exclude GDPR at system prompt NEVER rules |
| P-004 | Leaving placeholder text (unfilled template variables) in published artifact | F7 GOVERN check: scan for unfilled double-brace patterns |
| P-005 | Saying system "complies" | Builder documents evidence; provider DECLARES conformity via DoC (Art. 47) |
| P-006 | Generating Aug-2026 deadlines without flags | FLAG_DEADLINE_ITEMS config flag enforces [AUG-2026-DEADLINE] |

## High-Scoring Patterns (Evidence of What Works)

| Pattern | Score Impact | Evidence |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Named risks with R-00X IDs in RMS table | +0.5 D04 traceability | MedTriage golden example |
| Specific dataset names in data governance | +0.5 D03 evidence density | MedTriage golden example |
| Named XAI tools in human oversight | +0.3 D03 evidence density | MedTriage golden example |
| Art. 9 citation in every RMS paragraph | +0.3 D02 regulatory accuracy | Pattern from legal review |
| PMM table with quantified thresholds | +0.4 D01 completeness | PMM plan structure |
| [AUG-2026-DEADLINE] on all 6 mandatory items | +0.3 D05 auditability | Deadline compliance |
