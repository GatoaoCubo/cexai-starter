## Architectural Position
code_of_conduct sits in P05 (PRODUCE) as a community governance artifact. It is the trust foundation for open-source contributor ecosystems, produced by this builder and consumed by repositories, maintainers, and community participants. It interacts with contributor_guide-builder (technical onboarding) and github_issue_template-builder (issue reporting workflow) as complementary OSS community doc builders.
