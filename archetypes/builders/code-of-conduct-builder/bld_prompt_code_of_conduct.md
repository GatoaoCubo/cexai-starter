## Phase 1: RESEARCH
1. Identify the project type (solo OSS, foundation-backed, corporate-sponsored).
2. Determine enforcement capacity (maintainer count, response bandwidth).
3. Confirm reporting channel (contact email, dedicated moderation team).
4. Review existing community norms or prior conduct incidents.
5. Select base standard: Contributor Covenant v2.1 (default) or project-specific adaptation.
6. Identify which spaces the CoC covers (GitHub issues, forums, chat, events).

## Phase 2: COMPOSE
1. Reference bld_schema_code_of_conduct.md for required frontmatter fields.
2. Write the pledge section: "We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge..."
3. List positive standards (welcoming language, respect, constructive feedback).
4. List unacceptable behaviors (harassment, trolling, doxxing, discrimination).
5. Define enforcement responsibilities (maintainers, moderators).
6. Specify scope: online (repo, issues, PR comments) + offline (events, meetups).
7. Compose enforcement ladder with 4 levels: Correction, Warning, Temporary Ban, Permanent Ban.
8. Add reporting instructions with contact email and confidentiality statement.
9. Include attribution line referencing Contributor Covenant v2.1.
10. Add contact email placeholder with instruction to replace before publishing.
