## Crew Role
Produces code of conduct documents defining behavioral standards and enforcement procedures for OSS projects. The code of conduct is the community safety layer, placed before contributor_guide-builder (technical onboarding) and github_issue_template-builder (issue reporting).

## Receives From
| Builder                    | What                          | Format   |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|----------|
| contributor_guide-builder  | Project community norms input | Markdown |
| context_doc-builder        | Project scope + team structure| Markdown |
| knowledge_card-builder     | Community governance KC       | Markdown |

## Produces For
| Builder                         | What                           | Format   |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------|
| github_issue_template-builder   | CoC reference for issue bodies | Markdown |
| landing_page-builder            | Community health badge signal  | Markdown |
| contributor_guide-builder       | CoC link + enforcement summary | Markdown |

## Boundary
Does NOT handle technical contribution workflows (contributor_guide-builder), governance/voting processes (governance artifacts), or legal compliance documentation. Enforcement decisions remain with human maintainers; this builder produces the framework, not the decisions.
