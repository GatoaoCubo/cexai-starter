## Architectural Position
churn_prevention_playbook sits in P03/PRODUCE: it is a strategy artifact that produces
actionable intervention scripts. It receives NPS detractor signals from nps_survey (P11)
and health score data from CS platforms. It feeds escalation workflows (P12) and win-back
sequences. It is upstream of renewal_workflow but downstream of cohort_analysis.
