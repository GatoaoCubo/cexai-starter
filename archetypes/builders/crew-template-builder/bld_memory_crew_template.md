## Observation
Early crew blueprints tended to inline role backstories and goals inside the template body, duplicating content across templates that shared roles (e.g., `peer_reviewer` appeared verbatim in 5 crews). Review turnover showed process-topology was often wrong for the task graph: sequential picked for parallelizable work (editor + illustrator independent) and hierarchical picked where no delegation was needed (overkill).

## Pattern
Treat crew_template as a pure blueprint: reference role_assignment by id, declare process topology only after drawing the dependency graph, and always pair memory_scope with an explicit retention hint. Crews with success_criteria linked to a quality_gate (gate_id threshold) passed peer review 40% more often than those with free-text criteria.

## Evidence
- 12 crew templates reviewed in WAVE8: 8 with role refs passed H05 on first try; 4 with inlined roles failed H05 and required rebuild.
- Hierarchical process used when unnecessary cost 2x tokens per run (manager round-trip overhead) without quality improvement.
- Templates citing `p11_qg_*.md` in success_criteria scored 9.1 avg; those with prose criteria scored 7.8.

## Recommendations
- ALWAYS reference role_assignment by id; NEVER inline role identity.
- Draw the dependency graph before picking process (use workflow-builder upstream if complex).
- Prefer `sequential` for linear pipelines, `hierarchical` only for true delegation, `consensus` for peer-vote.
- Declare memory_scope per role using least-privilege: default to private, promote to shared only with justification.
- Link success_criteria to quality_gate IDs (`gate >= threshold`) instead of prose; easier to verify post-run.
- Document a `crewai_equivalent`, `autogen_equivalent`, `swarm_equivalent` to aid portability.
