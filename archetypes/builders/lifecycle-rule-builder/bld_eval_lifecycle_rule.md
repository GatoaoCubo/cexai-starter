## Quality Gate

# Gate: Lifecycle Rule
## Definition
A `lifecycle_rule` governs how an artifact kind moves through states from creation to sunset. It defines valid states, the measurable criteria that permit transitions, and the review cadence that keeps the rule current. Gates here ensure no rule is published with vague triggers, missing ownership, or an unverifiable review cycle.
## HARD Gates
All HARD gates must pass. Any single failure sets score to 0 and blocks publish.
| ID  | Check | Failure consequence |
|-----|-------|---------------------|
| H01 | YAML frontmatter parses without error | Artifact unparseable by tooling |
| H02 | `id` matches `^p11_lc_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$` | Namespace violation — not discoverable |
| H03 | `id` equals filename stem exactly | Brain search failure — id/file mismatch |
| H04 | `kind` == literal string `"lifecycle_rule"` | Type integrity failure |
| H05 | `quality` == `null` | Self-scoring violation — pool metric corruption |
| H06 | All required fields present and non-empty (`id`, `kind`, `pillar`, `version`, `created`, `updated`, `author`, `scope`, `ownership`, `freshness_days`, `review_cycle`, `tags`, `tldr`) | Incomplete artifact |
## SOFT Scoring
Weights sum to 100%. Each dimension scores 0 or its full weight.
| ID  | Dimension | Weight | Criteria |
|-----|-----------|--------|----------|
| S01 | tldr quality | 1.0 | `tldr` <= 160 chars, names the governed artifact kind |
| S02 | States exhaustive for domain | 1.0 | No reachable real state missing from States table |
| S03 | Transitions have measurable criteria | 1.0 | Each transition criterion is checkable without human judgment |
| S04 | Review cycle realistic | 1.0 | Cycle matches actual volatility of governed domain |
| S05 | Ownership assigned per state | 1.0 | Each state has a named owner role or agent_group |
| S06 | Freshness threshold justified | 0.5 | `freshness_days` rationale present (not arbitrary) |
## Actions
| Score | Tier | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| >= 9.5 | GOLDEN | Publish to pool + record in memory |
| >= 8.0 | PUBLISH | Commit to pool |
| >= 7.0 | REVIEW | Acceptable with documented improvement items |
| < 7.0 | REJECT | Revise and resubmit — do not publish |
| 0 (HARD fail) | REJECTED | Fix failing HARD gate(s) first |
## Bypass
Bypasses are logged and expire automatically.
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| condition | New artifact kind with no prior lifecycle precedent; states are draft and under active definition |
| approver | P11 governance owner (human) |

## Examples

```yaml
pillar: P07
llm_function: GOVERN
purpose: Golden and anti-examples of lifecycle_rule artifacts
pattern: few-shot learning — LLM reads these before producing
```
# Examples: lifecycle-rule-builder
## Golden Example
INPUT: "Define lifecycle rule for knowledge_cards — when do they go stale and get archived?"
OUTPUT:
```yaml
id: p11_lc_kc_freshness
kind: lifecycle_rule
pillar: P11
title: "Lifecycle: KC Freshness"
version: "1.0.0"
created: "2026-03-26"

author: "builder"
scope: "knowledge_card"
freshness_days: 90
review_cycle: "quarterly"
ownership: "knowledge-engine"
domain: "knowledge"
quality: null
tags: [lifecycle-rule, knowledge-card, freshness, quarterly]
tldr: "KCs become stale after 90 days; quarterly review by knowledge-engine promotes, refreshes, or archives"
notification: "signal"
automation: "semi"
density_score: 0.93
linked_artifacts:
  primary: "p11_qg_kc_publish"
  related: [p01_kc_schema, p10_knowledge_index]
## Definition
Knowledge cards lose accuracy as domains evolve. LLM pricing changes monthly,
framework APIs break quarterly, and research findings get superseded. A KC
cited confidently today may mislead an agent 6 months from now. This rule
ensures KCs are reviewed before staleness degrades downstream decisions.
## States
| State | Entry Criteria | Duration | Next |
|-------|---------------|----------|------|
| draft | Created, not yet reviewed | <= 7 days | active, rejected |
| active | Passes quality_gate >= 8.0 | <= 90 days | stale, promoted |
| promoted | Score >= 9.5 (golden) | <= 180 days | stale |
| stale | freshness_days exceeded without update | <= 30 days | refreshed, archived |
| refreshed | Stale KC updated and re-validated | <= 90 days | stale, promoted |
| archived | No longer relevant or superseded | permanent | sunset |
| sunset | Removed from active indexes | terminal | — |
## Transitions
| From | To | Trigger | Action | Automated |
|------|----|---------|--------|-----------|
| draft | active | quality_gate pass >= 8.0 | Index in brain, notify owner | yes |
| draft | rejected | quality_gate fail < 7.0 | Return to author with report | yes |
| active | stale | 90 days since last updated | Emit staleness signal, notify knowledge-engine | yes |
| active | promoted | quality_gate pass >= 9.5 | Tag as golden, priority index | yes |
| promoted | stale | 180 days since last updated | Emit staleness signal | yes |
| stale | refreshed | Owner updates and re-validates | Re-index, reset freshness timer | semi |

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
