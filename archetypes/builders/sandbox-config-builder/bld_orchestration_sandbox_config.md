## Crew Role  
Designs and validates sandbox isolation policies, ensuring secure resource boundaries for execution environments.  

## Receives From  
| Builder            | What                  | Format  |  
|-------------------|-----------------------|---------|  
| SecurityPolicyBuilder | Security constraints  | JSON    |  
| ResourceLimitBuilder  | CPU/Memory limits     | YAML    |  
| ComplianceChecker     | Regulatory rules      | XML     |  

## Produces For  
| Builder              | What                  | Format  |  
|---------------------|-----------------------|---------|  
| ExecutionEnvironmentBuilder | Isolated config   | JSON    |  
| MonitoringSystem      | Monitoring specs      | YAML    |  
| ConfigValidator       | Validation report     | JSON    |  

## Boundary  
Does NOT handle environment variables (env_config-builder) or execution logic (code_executor). UI/UX teams manage user-facing config interfaces.
