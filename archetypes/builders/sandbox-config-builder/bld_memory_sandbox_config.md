## Observation  
Common issues include incomplete isolation boundaries (e.g., network or filesystem leaks) and overly permissive resource limits, leading to security risks or performance instability. Misaligned config layers (e.g., mixing isolation policies with execution logic) often complicate debugging.  

## Pattern  
Effective configs use layered, declarative structures with explicit isolation scopes (e.g., `network: isolated`, `filesystem: read-only`). Modular components (e.g., reusable `seccomp` profiles) reduce duplication and improve maintainability.  

## Evidence  
Reviewed `secure_sandbox_template.yaml` and `isolation_policy_v2.json` showed consistent use of granular resource constraints and policy separation.  

## Recommendations  
- Define isolation boundaries explicitly, avoiding implicit defaults.  
- Use versioned policy modules for common isolation rules (e.g., `seccomp`, `cgroup`).  
- Validate configs against a sandbox-specific schema (e.g., `sandbox_config_v3.json`).  
- Document assumptions about host environment compatibility.  
- Include fallback mechanisms for unsupported isolation features.
