## Crew Role  
Designs and validates reranker configurations to optimize retrieval accuracy and relevance.  

## Receives From  
| Builder       | What                  | Format      |  
|---------------|-----------------------|-------------|  
| Product Team  | User requirements     | Document    |  
| Config Store  | Base config templates | JSON        |  
| Evaluator     | Feedback on rankings  | Evaluation  |  
| System Team   | Hardware constraints  | Technical   |  

## Produces For  
| Builder         | What                  | Format      |  
|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------|  
| Config Validator| Reranker config files | JSON/YAML   |  
| Deployment Team | Configuration docs    | Markdown    |  
| QA Team         | Validation test cases | Test script |  

## Boundary  
Does NOT handle retrieval logic (retriever) or first-stage retrieval configs (retriever_config-builder). Evaluation metrics and training data are managed by the evaluation team.
