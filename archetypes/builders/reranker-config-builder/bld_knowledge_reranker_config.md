## Domain Overview
Reranker_config defines strategies for reordering initial retrieval results using machine learning models, enhancing relevance in search and recommendation systems. Unlike first-stage retrievers (e.g., BM25, FAISS), rerankers apply fine-tuned models (e.g., dense retrievers, cross-encoders) to refine top-k candidates. Key applications include e-commerce product search, academic paper retrieval, and conversational AI, where precision over recall is critical. Modern systems often combine traditional scoring (e.g., cosine similarity) with neural ranking (e.g., BERT, DPR) to balance speed and accuracy.

Reranking addresses limitations of first-stage retrievers, such as lexical mismatch and lack of contextual understanding. Configurations may include model selection (e.g., RoBERTa, ALBERT), loss functions (e.g., pairwise hinge loss), and hybrid scoring (e.g., BM25 + neural scores). Industry adoption grows with advancements in transformer-based models and efficient inference frameworks (e.g., ONNX, TensorRT).

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Definition | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Cross-Encoder | Model that jointly encodes query and document for pairwise ranking | Vaswani et al., 2017 (Transformer) |
| Dense Retrieval | Embedding-based approach using neural networks for document ranking | Karpukhin et al., 2020 (DPR) |
| Pairwise Ranking | Training objective that maximizes relevance between positive and negative pairs | Burges et al., 2005 (RankNet) |
| NDCG | Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain, metric for evaluating ranked lists | Jarvelin & Kekäläinen, 2002 |
| BM25 | Probabilistic retrieval model based on term frequency-inverse document frequency | Robertson et al., 1994 |
| Hybrid Scoring | Combines traditional (e.g., BM25) and neural scores for robustness | Chen et al., 2020 (Neural IR) |
| Query Expansion | Enhances query representation using synonyms or embeddings | Clarke et al., 2008 |
| Late Interaction | Neural model architecture that processes query and document jointly | Xiong et al., 2020 (ColBERT) |

## Industry Standards
- Cohere Rerank v3 (cohere.com/rerank -- production cross-encoder API, supports multilingual)
- BGE reranker (BAAI/bge-reranker-large via HuggingFace -- open-source cross-encoder)
- ColBERT v2 (Khattab & Zaharia 2020 -- late-interaction model, Stanford NLP, RAGatouille wrapper)
- ms-marco cross-encoders (cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 -- BEIR benchmark leader)
- RankGPT (Sun et al. 2023 -- GPT-4 listwise reranking via sliding window)
- RankVicuna (Pradeep et al. 2023 -- open-source listwise reranker)
- TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) evaluation guidelines (NDCG@10, MAP, MRR)
- FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient vector retrieval

## Common Patterns
1. Use hybrid scoring (e.g., BM25 + neural) for robustness.
2. Deploy cross-encoders for high-precision pairwise ranking.
3. Apply dynamic thresholding to filter low-confidence reranks.
4. Use query-aware reranking to adapt to user intent.
5. Prioritize inference efficiency with quantized models (e.g., INT8).

## Pitfalls
- Overfitting to training data without domain-specific validation.
- Ignoring computational latency in production deployments.
- Misaligning reranker goals with business KPIs (e.g., click-through rate).
- Using outdated metrics (e.g., MAP) instead of task-specific ones (e.g., MRR).
- Neglecting query diversity in training, leading to biased rankings.
