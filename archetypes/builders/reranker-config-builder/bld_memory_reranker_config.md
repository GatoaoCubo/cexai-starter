## Observation
Common issues include inconsistent scoring function definitions, missing validation for input features, and unclear strategy prioritization leading to suboptimal reranking.

## Pattern
Effective configs use modular scoring components with explicit weightings and prioritize strategy alignment with downstream tasks (e.g., relevance vs. diversity).

## Evidence
Reviewed artifacts showed higher performance when scoring functions were versioned and strategy thresholds were tied to measurable metrics.

## Recommendations
- Define scoring functions and feature dependencies upfront.
- Use version control for strategy thresholds and model weights.
- Validate input feature compatibility during config assembly.
- Align reranking strategies with task-specific success metrics.
- Document trade-offs between strategy complexity and computational cost.
