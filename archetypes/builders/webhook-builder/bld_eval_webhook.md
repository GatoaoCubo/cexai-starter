## Quality Gate

# Gate: webhook

## HARD Gates (any failure = immediate reject)

| ID | Gate | Check |
|----|------|-------|
| H01 | YAML valid | Frontmatter parses without error |
| H02 | ID pattern | id matches `^p04_webhook_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$` |
| H03 | Kind correct | kind == "webhook" |
| H04 | Quality null | quality == null (never self-scored) |
| H05 | Required fields | id, name, direction, event_type, payload_schema all present |
| H06 | Direction enum | direction is exactly "inbound" or "outbound" |

## SOFT Scoring (0-10 per dimension, threshold >= 7.0)

| Dim | Name | What earns full score |
|-----|------|-----------------------|
| S01 | Event coverage | All event_types listed with trigger conditions |
| S02 | Payload docs | Each event has payload_schema with field descriptions |
| S03 | Signature verification | Method + header + secret env var documented |
| S04 | Retry policy | max_attempts, backoff strategy, backoff_base_ms present |
| S05 | Idempotency | idempotency_key field identified in payload |
| S06 | Error handling | Dead-letter or failure fallback described |

## Scoring Formula

```
soft_score = mean(S01..S12)
pass = all(H01..H10) AND soft_score >= 7.0
```

## Common Failures

- H06: direction = "receive" instead of "inbound" — use enum values only
- H08: payload_schema: {} — must define at minimum `type: object`
- H09: body too long — compress examples, remove prose padding
- S03: inbound webhook with signature_method: none — security gate will flag

## Examples

# Examples: webhook
## GOLDEN — Stripe payment.completed (inbound)
**Prompt**: "Create webhook for Stripe payment.completed inbound"
**Output**:

## Overview
Inbound webhook receiving Stripe PaymentIntent events. HMAC-SHA256 signature verified via Stripe-Signature header before payload processing.
## Events
### payment_intent.succeeded
**Trigger**: Charge captured, funds confirmed.
**Payload**: `{"id":"evt_01","type":"payment_intent.succeeded","data":{"object":{"id":"pi_01","amount":4999,"currency":"usd"}}}`
### payment_intent.payment_failed
**Trigger**: Charge declined or auth failed.
**Payload**: `{"id":"evt_02","type":"payment_intent.payment_failed","data":{"object":{"id":"pi_02","last_payment_error":{"code":"card_declined"}}}}`
## Verification
- **Method**: hmac_sha256 via `Stripe-Signature` header
- **Secret**: env var `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- **Algorithm**: `t=timestamp,v1=signature` — verify before parse
## Retry & Delivery
- **Max attempts**: 5 over 3 days (Stripe managed)
- **Timeout**: 30000ms — respond 2xx within 30s
- **Idempotency**: `data.object.id` — deduplicate on PaymentIntent ID
- **Dead-letter**: `webhook_failures` table after 5 retries
```
**Gate result**: PASS — H01-H10 pass, soft_score ~8.8
## ANTI-PATTERN — Broken minimal artifact
**Prompt**: "Create webhook" (no direction, no event, no schema)
**Bad output** (annotated):
```markdown
---
id: my_webhook          # FAIL H02: missing p04_webhook_ prefix
kind: webhook
direction: receive      # FAIL H06: must be "inbound" not "receive"
event_type: ""          # FAIL H07: empty string
payload_schema: {}      # FAIL H08: empty schema
quality: 8.5            # FAIL H04: must be null
tags: [webhook]
tldr: "My webhook"

## Overview
This webhook receives events.
```
**Gate failures**:
- H02: id `my_webhook` — missing `p04_webhook_` prefix
- H04: quality must be null, not 8.5
- H06: direction "receive" not in enum {inbound, outbound}
- H07: event_type empty string
**Corrective**: Ask for direction, event source, event name, payload fields before producing.

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
