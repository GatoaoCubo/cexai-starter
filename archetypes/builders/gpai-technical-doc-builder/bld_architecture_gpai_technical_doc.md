## Architectural Position
gpai_technical_doc is the EU AI Act compliance artifact within CEX P11. It bridges EU legal requirements (Article 53 / Annex IV) and structured model documentation. Distinct from: model_card (informal), compliance_framework (policy mapping), conformity_assessment (high-risk systems). Upstream inputs: training metadata from ML engineering, evaluation results from N05, energy data from infrastructure. Downstream: EU AI Office submission, downstream provider agreements.
