## Observation
Most GPAI providers submitted incomplete technical documentation in the first wave (August-September 2025) due to missing energy consumption data and vague downstream-limit clauses. EU AI Office review guidance highlighted these as the two most common rejection reasons.

## Pattern
Documents structured with explicit Annex IV section headers (Section 1-8) have 50% lower revision rates than free-form technical documentation. Energy data submitted with GHG Protocol methodology reference passes EU AI Office data quality checks.

## Evidence
EU AI Office public guidance (Q3 2025) cited 3 most common deficiencies: (1) vague downstream-limit clauses, (2) missing energy consumption reporting, (3) absent EU representative for non-EU providers. Documents using standardized Annex IV templates had 70% first-submission acceptance rate vs 30% for narrative formats.

## Recommendations
- Energy consumption: always use GHG Protocol Scope 2 market-based methodology with grid factor.
- Downstream-limit clauses: enumerate at least 5 specific prohibited use cases -- never use "harmful uses" as a catch-all.
- Non-EU providers: include EU representative field even if not legally mandated yet -- EU AI Office reviewers flag absence.
- FLOP estimate: use scientific notation (e.g., 3.2 x 10^23) not informal descriptions like "massive compute".
- Version the document: EU AI Office requires tracking of doc versions across model updates.
