title: "User Journey for CRM Platform Adoption"
kind: user_journey
author: A. Smith, UX Researcher
date: 2023-10-15
tools: CRM Platform, Chat Tool, Payment Gateway, Video Conferencing
---
**Awareness**
- Touchpoint: LinkedIn ad (CRM Platform)
- User Action: Clicks "Start Free Trial"
- Emotion: Curiosity
- Pain Point: No clear ROI from current tools

**Consideration**
- Touchpoint: Demo request via chat (Support Widget)
- User Action: Schedules video call with sales
- Emotion: Skepticism
- Pain Point: Unclear integration with existing workflows

**Conversion**
- Touchpoint: Payment gateway checkout page
- User Action: Completes 30-day trial
- Emotion: Excitement
- Pain Point: No immediate value visible

**Retention**
- Touchpoint: Weekly onboarding emails (CRM Platform)
- User Action: Completes 70% of tutorial
- Emotion: Frustration
- Pain Point: Missing key features

**Advocacy**
- Touchpoint: NPS survey (Survey Tool)
- User Action: Recommends to peers
- Emotion: Satisfaction
- Pain Point: None

## Anti-Example 1: Confusing journey with workflow
---
**Awareness**
- Touchpoint: Website homepage
- User Action: Clicks "Sign Up"
- Emotion: None
- Pain Point: None

**Why it fails**: Focuses only on a single action ("Sign Up") without mapping emotional states, touchpoints across channels, or long-term engagement. It’s a workflow, not a journey.

## Anti-Example 2: Generic placeholders
---
**Awareness**
- Touchpoint: "ProviderA ad"
- User Action: "Clicks link"
- Emotion: "Curiosity"
- Pain Point: "No clear value"

**Why it fails**: Uses vague terms like "ProviderA" and "no clear value" without context. Fails to specify real tools, user emotions, or actionable insights for improvement.

### H_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (HARD)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (min 3 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream or sibling reference
- Gate: REJECT if < 3 entries (auto-populated by cex_wikilink.py at F6.5)

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
