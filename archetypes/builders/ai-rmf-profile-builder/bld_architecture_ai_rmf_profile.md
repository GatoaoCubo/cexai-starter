## Architectural Position
ai_rmf_profile occupies the governance compliance intersection within CEX P11 (Feedback/Governance). It bridges NIST AI-RMF policy requirements and CEX artifact production, enabling structured profile artifacts that map AI system risks to AI-RMF actions. Upstream: compliance_framework (broader regulatory mapping). Downstream: threat_model (risk analysis), safety_policy (org-level enforcement). Crosswalk: iso_42001 controls, EU AI Act obligations.
