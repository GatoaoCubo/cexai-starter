## Phase 1: RESEARCH
1. Identify the AI system or domain being profiled (e.g., GenAI chatbot, automated decision system, recommendation engine).
2. Determine applicable AI 600-1 GenAI risk categories relevant to the system.
3. Map organizational context to NIST AI-RMF functions (GOVERN/MAP/MEASURE/MANAGE).
4. Gather existing governance policies, risk registers, and audit findings.
5. Identify action-IDs from the NIST AI-RMF Playbook applicable to identified risks.
6. Cross-reference with ISO/IEC 42001 controls and EU AI Act obligations for crosswalk table.

## Phase 2: COMPOSE
1. Reference SCHEMA for required fields (profile scope, function coverage, risk categories, action-IDs).
2. For each of 4 functions (GOVERN/MAP/MEASURE/MANAGE), list applicable action-IDs and implementation status.
3. For each of 12 GenAI risk categories, assign severity level and map to controlling action-IDs.
4. Populate crosswalk table linking AI-RMF actions to ISO 42001 controls (where applicable).
5. Document risk response approach per category (Accept / Mitigate / Transfer / Avoid).
6. Include profile scope declaration: system name, deployment context, profiler identity, review date.
7. Flag gaps where action-IDs have no implementation assigned.
8. Add evidence pointers (policy docs, test results, audit logs) per action-ID where available.
9. Proofread for action-ID format consistency (e.g., GV-1.1 not "Govern 1.1").

## Phase 3: VALIDATE
- [ ] All 4 functions (GOVERN/MAP/MEASURE/MANAGE) addressed with at least 1 action-ID each.
- [ ] All 12 GenAI risk-categories from AI 600-1 listed with severity assignments.
- [ ] Action-IDs follow NIST format (GV/MP/MS/MG prefix + numeric suffix).
- [ ] Profile scope field present (system name, context, review date).
- [ ] Crosswalk table has at least ISO 42001 column populated.
- [ ] No action-ID referenced that does not exist in NIST AI-RMF Playbook v1.0.
