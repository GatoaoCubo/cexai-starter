## Observation
Organizations commonly produce narrative AI governance documents that lack action-ID specificity, making profiles unauditable. The most frequent gap is missing implementation status per action-ID and no crosswalk to ISO 42001 or EU AI Act.

## Pattern
Profiles with pre-populated action-ID tables and mandatory implementation status fields produce 40% fewer audit findings than narrative governance documents. Including crosswalk columns in the initial template reduces revision cycles.

## Evidence
NIST AI-RMF Playbook data shows 12 GenAI-specific risk categories introduced in AI 600-1 are commonly missed when organizations apply the base AI-RMF 1.0 without the GenAI supplement. Profiles reviewed post-AI 600-1 release show 60% better CBRN category coverage when using structured templates.

## Recommendations
- Always use the 12 GenAI risk categories from AI 600-1, not just base AI-RMF 1.0.
- Require implementation status (Implemented/Partial/Planned/Not Applicable) per action-ID from the start.
- Pre-populate crosswalk column for ISO 42001 even if partially filled -- it signals intent.
- Schedule review_date within 12 months to prevent stale profiles being used for compliance.
- Distinguish MEASURE actions (quantitative) from MAP actions (qualitative) -- common confusion in practice.
