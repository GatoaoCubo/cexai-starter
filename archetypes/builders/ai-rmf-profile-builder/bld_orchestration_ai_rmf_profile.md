## Crew Role
Produces structured NIST AI-RMF profile artifacts mapping organizational AI risks to AI-RMF functions and action-IDs per AI 600-1 GenAI categories.

## Receives From
| Builder | What | Format |
|---------|------|--------|
| compliance_framework-builder | Existing regulatory mapping context | Markdown |
| threat_model-builder | Risk inventory and severity assessments | Markdown |
| safety_policy-builder | Organizational safety policies for evidence pointers | Markdown |
| N01 Intelligence | NIST Playbook action-ID references and crosswalk data | Knowledge Card |

## Produces For
| Builder | What | Format |
|---------|------|--------|
| compliance_framework-builder | AI-RMF profile as input to broader compliance mapping | Markdown |
| safety_policy-builder | Action-ID gaps informing new policy requirements | Markdown |
| guardrail-builder | Risk category controls informing runtime guardrails | Markdown |
| N05 Operations | Profile evidence pointers triggering evaluation tasks | Markdown |

## Boundary
Does NOT handle EU AI Act documentation (use gpai_technical_doc-builder), runtime safety enforcement (use guardrail-builder), or safety hazard classification (use safety_hazard_taxonomy-builder). Legal sign-off and final audit evidence are managed by compliance/legal teams, not this builder.
