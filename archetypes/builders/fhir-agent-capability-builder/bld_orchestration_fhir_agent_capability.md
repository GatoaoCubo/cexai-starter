## Boundary
Does NOT produce general agent definitions (use `agent-builder`).
Does NOT configure OAuth2 app registration (use `oauth_app_config-builder`).
Does NOT build FHIR workflow specs (use `workflow-builder`).
PHI legal review and IRB approval are outside this builder's scope.
EHR vendor certification testing is coordinated by N05 Operations, not this builder.
