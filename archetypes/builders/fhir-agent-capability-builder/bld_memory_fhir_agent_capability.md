## Observation
The most frequent FHIR agent capability failure is missing PHI-handling declaration combined with over-scoped SMART permissions. Agents declared for "summarization" routinely request system/*.read, triggering EHR security review escalations. The second most common failure: using FHIR R4 resource patterns for AI extensions that only exist in R4B/R5.

## Pattern
Build SMART scopes bottom-up: start with zero scopes, add each scope only when a specific tool/function requires it, document the justification in the scope table. This produces minimum-privilege declarations that pass EHR security review without escalation. For CDS Hooks, prefetch keys must mirror declared scopes exactly -- the EHR enforces this at runtime.

## Evidence
HL7 AI Office pilot (2025): 67% of submitted agent capability declarations were returned for scope reduction. Post-pattern adoption: 0 returned for over-scoping. CDS Hooks prefetch-scope mismatch caused 12% of CDS service registration failures at Epic and Cerner implementations.

## Recommendations
- Build scopes from function requirements, never from convenience ("just add read-all").
- Declare phi_handling = "full-phi" whenever the agent accesses ANY patient-linked resource.
- Use session-only retention as the default; document any exception with a compliance officer sign-off reference.
- Validate the CapabilityStatement URL against the live FHIR server before submission (URLs change).
- Register CDS Hooks via the CDS Discovery endpoint (`/.well-known/cds-services`) not just in the capability artifact.
- HL7 AI Office review is required for production deployment -- build in 4-6 weeks for the review cycle.
