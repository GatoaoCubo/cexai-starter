| difflib (Python stdlib)| SequenceMatcher, unified_diff, ndiff, HtmlDiff| Line/char diff in Python agents     |
| libxdiff              | Myers + histogram diff (used inside git)     | C-level performance; git internals  |
| diff-match-patch (Google)| Bitap algorithm for fuzzy patch application| Web/JS environments; fuzzy matching |
| bsdiff/bspatch        | Binary file delta compression                | Binary assets, executables          |
| xdelta3               | Delta encoding for large binary streams      | Incremental updates, ROM patching   |

| patch (POSIX)         | Apply unified diff to file tree              | `patch -p1 < file.diff`             |
| git apply             | Apply patch with git context                 | `git apply --3way --whitespace=fix` |
| git apply --3way      | Three-way merge fallback on conflict         | `git apply --3way file.diff`        |
| git merge-file        | Three-way merge of 3 versions                | `git merge-file local base remote`  |
