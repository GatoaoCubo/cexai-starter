## Observation
Developers often introduce noise by conflating structural changes with content-only differences. Overly aggressive fuzzy matching frequently leads to incorrect patch applications in edge cases.

## Pattern
Decoupling the detection algorithm from the application logic ensures higher reliability. Implementing a strategy-based approach allows for switching between strict and lenient matching without altering the core engine.

## Evidence
Reviewed recent implementations of text-based and structural diffing modules.

## Recommendations
* Isolate the matching algorithm from the patch application logic.
* Define explicit thresholds for fuzzy matching to prevent drift.
* Standardize whitespace and line-ending handling within the strategy.
* Avoid including parsing or formatting logic in the strategy builder.
* Implement regression tests specifically for character-shift edge cases.
