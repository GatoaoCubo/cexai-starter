## Domain Overview
The diff_strategy domain governs the logic used to identify, compute, and apply transformations between two states. It focuses on the algorithmic selection of the minimal edit script (Insert, Delete, Keep) and the reconciliation logic required to merge divergent histories.

Unlike parsing or formatting, this domain is concerned with the mathematical and structural integrity of the transformation. It encompasses the decision-making process for resolving overlaps, handling conflicts, and ensuring that a patch applied to a base version results in the intended target state, even in the presence of concurrent modifications.

| Unified Diff             | @@ -L,S +L,S @@ format; standard patch interchange     | POSIX.1-2017                |
| Context Diff             | Older !!! format; 3-line context window default         | BSD diff (pre-POSIX)        |
| SES (Shortest Edit Script)| Optimal sequence of edits from source to target        | Myers (1986)                |
