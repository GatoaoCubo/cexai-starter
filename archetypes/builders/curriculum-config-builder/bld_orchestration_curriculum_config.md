# Collaboration: curriculum-config-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer: "in what order and proportion should training data be presented?"
I do not generate data. I do not define model architecture.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Training Data Pipeline"
```
1. synthetic-data-config-builder -> "data generation"
2. curriculum-config-builder -> "training data scheduling"
3. distillation-config-builder -> "teacher-student training"
4. eval-metric-builder -> "quality evaluation"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: training task, data sources, model type, quality targets
### I Produce
- curriculum_config artifact (.md with YAML frontmatter)
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score)
## Builders I Depend On
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| synthetic-data-config-builder | Provides generated data sources for curriculum |
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| distillation-config-builder | Uses curriculum schedule for training data ordering |
## Integration Points
| Point | Direction | Protocol |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| F8 COLLABORATE | outbound | signal_writer.write_signal() |
| F3 INJECT | inbound | Receives upstream artifacts via handoff |
| dataset_card | upstream | Must exist before curriculum config production |
| training_method | upstream | Must exist before curriculum config production |
| eval_metric | upstream | Must exist before curriculum config production |
## Dependencies
| Dependency | Required | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| dataset_card | yes | Upstream artifact for curriculum config |
| training_method | yes | Upstream artifact for curriculum config |
| eval_metric | yes | Upstream artifact for curriculum config |
