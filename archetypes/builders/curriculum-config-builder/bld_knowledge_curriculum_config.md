# Domain Knowledge: curriculum_config
## Executive Summary
Curriculum configs define the order and proportion in which training data is presented to a model during fine-tuning or pretraining. They specify difficulty progression, data mixing ratios, task scheduling, and annealing strategies. A curriculum_config is a P07 artifact -- it defines the TRAINING SCHEDULE, not the model architecture or data content.
## Spec Table
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Pillar | P07 (evaluation) |
| Strategies | easy-to-hard, self-paced, competence-based, data mixing |
| Scheduling | linear, exponential, step-wise, cosine annealing |
| Key parameters | difficulty metric, mixing ratios, warmup fraction, annealing schedule |
## Patterns
- **Easy-to-hard** -- present simpler examples first, gradually increase difficulty; accelerates convergence
- **Self-paced** -- model selects training examples based on current loss; adapts to model capacity
- **Competence-based** -- unlock harder data when model demonstrates competence on easier data
- **Data mixing** -- blend multiple data sources in specified ratios; ratios may shift over training
- **Annealing** -- gradually shift data distribution from general to domain-specific toward end of training
- **Multi-task scheduling** -- cycle through tasks in specified proportions per training step
## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why it fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| Random ordering only | Misses curriculum benefits; wastes training compute on noise early |
| No difficulty metric | Cannot implement curriculum without defining what "hard" means |
| Fixed mixing forever | Optimal ratios change as model learns; static mixing suboptimal |
| No warmup | Jumping to hard examples early causes training instability |
| Ignoring data quality | Curriculum on noisy data amplifies noise in the chosen order |
