# Instructions: How to Produce a curriculum_config

## Phase 1: RESEARCH

1. Identify the training task: pretraining, fine-tuning, multi-task, domain adaptation
2. Catalog available data sources with size and domain
3. Define difficulty metric: perplexity, length, complexity score, annotation confidence
4. Select curriculum strategy: easy-to-hard, self-paced, competence-based, data mixing
5. Determine annealing schedule if applicable
6. Check existing curriculum_config artifacts to avoid duplication

## Phase 2: COMPOSE

1. Read SCHEMA -- source of truth for all fields
2. Fill all frontmatter fields; set quality: null
3. Write Strategy section: selected approach with rationale
4. Write Data Sources section: sources, sizes, mixing ratios
5. Write Difficulty section: metric definition and progression schedule
6. Write Schedule section: warmup, phases, annealing
7. Write Checkpoints section: evaluation points and competence gates

## Phase 3: VALIDATE

1. Check HARD gates: YAML parses, id matches, kind correct
2. Verify strategy specified with rationale
3. Verify difficulty metric defined
4. Verify data sources listed with mixing ratios
5. Cross-check: this is CURRICULUM CONFIG, not data generation or model architecture

## Token Budget

| Component | Allocation | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| System prompt | 15%% | Builder identity + sin lens |
| Context (ISOs) | 40%% | 12 ISOs loaded per builder |
| Domain knowledge | 25%% | KCs + examples + memory |
| Generation headroom | 20%% | Artifact output space |

## Style Constraints

| Dimension | Guideline |
|-----------|-----------|
| Voice | Technical, precise, builder-appropriate |
| Structure | Tables over prose; data over description |
| Density | >= 0.85; every sentence adds information |
| References | Use canonical kind names, not synonyms |
