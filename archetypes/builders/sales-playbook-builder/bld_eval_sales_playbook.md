## Examples

## Golden Example
**Frontmatter**:
```yaml
title: Sales Playbook for CRM Platform Implementation
target_account: Mid-market SaaS companies
created_by: Sales Enablement Team, Acme AI
last_updated: 2023-10-05
```
**Body**:
### Personas
- **Primary Buyer**: Marketing Director at a mid-sized e-commerce company (e.g., "A. Smith," 35, 8 years in digital marketing).
- **Influencer**: IT Manager concerned about data security (e.g., "J. Lee," 40, 12 years in enterprise tech).

### Discovery Flow
1. **Initial Contact**: Ask, "What’s your current CRM’s biggest pain point?"
2. **Needs Assessment**: Explore integration with existing tools and chat platforms.
3. **Solution Demo**: Highlight the platform’s automation and analytics.
4. **Negotiation**: Align pricing with ROI from lead generation improvements.

### Objection Handling
- **Objection**: "We’re happy with our current system."
  **Response**: "Let’s compare your current system’s lead conversion rate with our platform’s 30% improvement benchmark."

### Close Patterns
- **Time-Sensitive Offer**: "Our Q4 discount ends October 31 -- can we lock this in today?"
- **ROI Guarantee**: "If the platform doesn’t deliver 20% faster sales cycles, we’ll refund 50% of the first year’s cost."

## Anti-Example 1: Vague Personas
**Frontmatter**:
```yaml
title: Sales Playbook for "ProviderA"
target_account: "Any company"
created_by: "Sales Team"
```
**Body**:
### Personas
- **Primary Buyer**: "Someone in marketing who cares about efficiency."

### Discovery Flow
- "Ask them about their goals."

### Objection Handling
- "They say ‘no’? Try again later."

## Why it fails
Lacks specificity in personas, discovery steps, and objections. Sales reps can’t tailor approaches without concrete examples or strategies.

## Anti-Example 2: Missing Key Sections
**Frontmatter**:
```yaml
title: Sales Playbook for "ExampleModel"
target_account: Startups
created_by: "SomeVendor"
```
**Body**:
### Personas
- **Primary Buyer**: Startup founder (e.g., "R. Tanaka," 28, founder of a fintech startup).

### Discovery Flow
- "Discuss their product."

## Why it fails
Omits objection handling and close patterns, making the playbook incomplete. Sales teams can’t address common objections or apply proven closing techniques.

### H_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (HARD)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (min 3 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream or sibling reference
- Gate: REJECT if < 3 entries (auto-populated by cex_wikilink.py at F6.5)

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
