## Architectural Position
The sales_playbook-builder (P03) serves as the central orchestration layer for sales strategy automation within the CEX ecosystem, enabling dynamic generation of customer-facing playbooks through structured ISO interactions. It integrates domain-specific knowledge (bld_knowledge_card) with configurable workflows (bld_config) to produce validated, reusable sales assets aligned with enterprise-grade compliance and operational standards.
