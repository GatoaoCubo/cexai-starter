# Domain Knowledge: research_pipeline

## Executive Summary
A research pipeline is a config-driven system that collects, scores, synthesizes, and verifies market intelligence from 30+ sources. Built on three academic patterns: **STORM** (multi-perspective query planning from Stanford), **CRAG** (Corrective RAG with per-source quality gates), and **CRITIC** (iterative self-verification with thinking models). The CEX research-pipeline-builder distills a 13,908-line production system into a reusable 7-stage pattern.

## The 3 Core Patterns

### STORM (Survey of Topic via Retrieval and Organization of Multi-perspective)
- **Paper**: Stanford/UW 2024 — generates Wikipedia-quality articles from scratch
- **CEX adaptation**: generate 5 expert perspectives per research query, each decomposed into 5-7 atomic sub-questions. This multiplies retrieval coverage 25-35x vs single-query.
- **Why it works**: single-angle research misses competitor blind spots, buyer pain points, and market trends. STORM's multi-perspective approach covers all angles systematically.

### CRAG (Corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- **Paper**: Yan et al 2024 — evaluates retrieval quality before using it
- **CEX adaptation**: every retrieved result gets a quality score (0.0-1.0). Below threshold (default 0.7) → trigger fallback source or discard. Prevents low-quality data from polluting synthesis.
- **Quality dimensions**: relevance, recency, completeness, trustworthiness.

### CRITIC (Self-Correcting with Tool-Interactive Critique)
- **Paper**: Gou et al 2024 — LLM verifies own output, correct with tools
- **CEX adaptation**: Stage 7 uses a thinking model (o4-mini) to verify synthesis against source data. Catches hallucinations, numerical errors, contradictions. Max 3 iterations — diminishing returns after that.

## 7-Stage Pipeline
| Stage | Name | Model | Input | Output |
|-------|------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | INTENT | Fast classifier | User query | domain, verb, complexity, route |
| 2 | PLAN (STORM) | Reasoning model | Intent + perspectives | 25-35 sub-questions |
| 3 | RETRIEVE (CRAG) | APIs + scraping | Sub-questions | Scored results (≥0.7) |
| 4 | RESOLVE | Deterministic | Raw results | Deduplicated entities |
| 5 | SCORE | Fast model | Entities | Gartner 7-dim scored listings |
| 6 | SYNTHESIZE (GoT) | Domain models | Scored data | Structured analysis |
| 7 | VERIFY (CRITIC) | Thinking model | Synthesis + sources | Verified report |

## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| Single-query retrieval | Misses 80% of relevant data (no perspective diversity) |
| No quality gate on retrieval | Garbage in → garbage out; CRAG prevents this |
| Single-model synthesis | Different domains need different models; Flash for extraction, GPT for reasoning |
| No verification step | 15-20% of LLM synthesis contains hallucinations; CRITIC catches them |
| Unlimited scraping budget | Firecrawl/Serper credits drain fast; budget caps are essential |
| Hardcoded source list | Every niche needs different sources; config must be flexible |
