## Learned Patterns

### Pattern 1: Always default to max_iterations: 3
The design spec proved 3 iterations as the optimal balance: enough for content-quality
convergence, not so many that the pipeline stalls. Override only when scenario demands it.

### Pattern 2: escalation_target selection heuristic
| Pipeline Mode | Target | Rationale |
|--------------|--------|-----------|
| Interactive (user present) | `user` | Human review is feasible |
| Automated with N07 available | `senior_nucleus` | N07 can re-plan |
| Overnight/headless | `freeze` | No human to route to; log for morning review |

### Pattern 3: Quality floor vs publish minimum
- Quality floor (8.5): triggers a new revision cycle -- not the same as the publish gate
- Publish minimum (8.0): CEX system floor -- an artifact can publish at 8.0 without triggering revision
- Target (9.0): N03 inventive pride standard -- aim for this on all production artifacts

### Pattern 4: Per-scenario override table is NOT optional
Always include at minimum `security_critical: 5` and `documentation: 2`.
for security audits.

### Pattern 5: escalation_message_template is a contract
Recipients of the escalation message (user, senior_nucleus) use the message to understand
WHAT failed (the failing_gates list) and HOW MANY times (the max_iterations count) the pipeline tried.
Never use a generic message like "too many retries" -- it provides no actionable context.

## Anti-Pattern Registry

| Anti-Pattern | Consequence | Fix |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| priority_order with only 2 items | H03 gate fails | Always include all 3: [security, quality, implementation] |
| Swapping security and quality positions | Wrong conflict resolution | security MUST be index 0 |
| max_iterations: 0 | No revisions attempted | Minimum is 1; for no revisions use quality_gate directly |
| Generic escalation_message_template | Unactionable escalation | Must contain the max_iterations and failing_gates placeholder tokens |
| Using revision_loop_policy for network retries | Wrong kind | Route to retry_policy (P09) |

## Build History Context
- W1.6 kind assimilation (2026-04-18): initial kind creation from multi-agent spec
- Designed to work with pipeline_template (W1.5) which references revision loops
