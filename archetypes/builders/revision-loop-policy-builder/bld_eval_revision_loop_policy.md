## Quality Gate
## HARD Gates (all must pass)
| ID | Criterion | Failure Action |
|----|-----------|---------------|
| H01 | `kind == "revision_loop_policy"` | block |
| H02 | `max_iterations` is a positive integer (>= 1) | block |
| H03 | `priority_order == [security, quality, implementation]` (exact order, all 3) | block |
| H04 | `escalation_target` in `{user, senior_nucleus, freeze}` | block |
| H05 | `escalation_message_template` contains `{{max_iterations}}` AND `{{failing_gates}}` | block |
| H06 | `quality == null` (never self-score) | block |
## SOFT Gates (weighted, sum = 1.0)
| ID | Criterion | Weight | Scoring Method |
|----|-----------|--------|---------------|
| S01 | Boundaries section present with all 4 NOT-items | 0.25 | binary |
| S02 | `per_scenario_overrides` includes `security_critical` and `documentation` | 0.25 | binary |
| S03 | Usage in `pipeline_template` code block present in body | 0.25 | binary |
| S04 | `tags` includes `hermes_origin` | 0.25 | binary |
## Scoring Formula
```
aggregate_score = S01*0.25 + S02*0.25 + S03*0.25 + S04*0.25
PASS: all H gates pass AND aggregate_score >= 0.85
FAIL: any H gate fails OR aggregate_score < 0.85
```
## Actions
| Outcome | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| PASS | Artifact proceeds to F8 COLLABORATE (compile + commit + signal) |
| H-FAIL | Artifact returned with specific HARD gate failure detail; fix and retry |
| S-FAIL | Artifact returned with soft gate breakdown; improve and retry (max 2 retries) |
## Bypass Policy
- Who may override: `owner` (N03 builder or N05 operations nucleus)
- Conditions: only H06 (quality: null) may be bypassed in peer-review mode (peer sets actual score)
- All other HARD gates: no bypass permitted
- Audit: log bypass with actor, timestamp, and justification
## Examples
## Golden Example 1: Standard Policy (default)
```yaml
---
id: rlp_standard
kind: revision_loop_policy
pillar: P11
title: "Revision Policy: Standard"
max_iterations: 3
iteration_on_quality_floor: 8.5
priority_order: [security, quality, implementation]
```yaml
revision_loop:
 policy_ref: rlp_standard
 max_iterations: 3
 escalation_target: user
```
```
## Golden Example 2: Security-Critical Override
```yaml
---
id: rlp_security_critical
kind: revision_loop_policy
pillar: P11
title: "Revision Policy: Security Critical"
max_iterations: 5
iteration_on_quality_floor: 9.0
priority_order: [security, quality, implementation]
```
**Why it works:** max_iterations elevated to 5 for security sensitivity. Quality floor raised to 9.0
(tighter than standard). Escalation routes to senior_nucleus (automated) rather than user (manual).
Overrides cover all three canonical scenarios.
## Golden Example 3: Freeze Policy (Fully Automated Pipeline)
```yaml
---
id: rlp_freeze_on_fail
kind: revision_loop_policy
pillar: P11
title: "Revision Policy: Freeze on Exhaustion"
max_iterations: 3
iteration_on_quality_floor: 8.5
priority_order: [security, quality, implementation]
```
**Why it works:** `escalation_target: freeze` is appropriate for overnight headless pipelines where
there is no user to route to. The pipeline freezes and logs; a human reviews the next morning.
## Anti-Example 1: Missing escalation_message_template placeholders
```yaml
---
id: rlp_bad_template
kind: revision_loop_policy
max_iterations: 3
escalation_message_template: "Too many attempts"
---
```
**Why it fails (H05):** `escalation_message_template` must contain `{{max_iterations}}` AND
`{{failing_gates}}` to provide actionable context to the escalation target.
"Too many attempts" gives the recipient no information about what failed or how many cycles ran.
## Anti-Example 2: Invalid priority_order
```yaml
---
id: rlp_bad_priority
kind: revision_loop_policy
max_iterations: 3
priority_order: [quality, security]
escalation_target: user
---
```
**Why it fails (H03):** `priority_order` must contain all three tiers: `[security, quality, implementation]`.
Omitting `implementation` means implementation-gate conflicts have no defined resolution order.
Reordering security below quality violates the canonical order (security is always first).

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
-  `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
-  `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
-  At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
