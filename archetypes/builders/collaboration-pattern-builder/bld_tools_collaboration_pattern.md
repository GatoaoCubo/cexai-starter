# Tools -- collaboration-pattern-builder
## Tool Registry
| Tool | Status | Tag | Purpose |
|------|--------|-----|---------|
| brain_query | CONDITIONAL | [MCP] | Discover existing collaboration topologies and coordination patterns |
| Read | ACTIVE | [FS] | Read SCHEMA.md, OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md, sibling examples |
| Glob | ACTIVE | [FS] | Find existing p12_collab_* files in the pool |
| Grep | ACTIVE | [FS] | Search for topology types or agent role patterns |
| Write | ACTIVE | [FS] | Produce the final collaboration_pattern artifact |
| Edit | ACTIVE | [FS] | Patch frontmatter or body sections during VALIDATE phase |

## Tool Descriptions
### brain_query [MCP] -- CONDITIONAL
Available only when the Brain MCP server is running. Use to:
- Find existing `collaboration_pattern` artifacts that overlap with the requested domain
- Retrieve topology type vocabulary used in the pool
- Identify conflict resolution strategies already documented

```
brain_query("collaboration pattern mesh hierarchical topology")
brain_query("P12 kind:collaboration_pattern domain:{{domain}}")
brain_query("multi-agent coordination channel protocol")
```

Mark results as advisory -- validate topology types against SCHEMA.md before adopting.

### Read [FS] -- ACTIVE
Read before composing:
- `SCHEMA.md` -- source of truth for all field definitions
- `OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md` -- exact frontmatter and body structure to follow
- `QUALITY_GATES.md` -- gate list to validate against
- Sibling p12_collab_* files for naming and style reference

### Glob [FS] -- ACTIVE
```
records/pool/**/p12_collab_*.md
archetypes/builders/collaboration-pattern-builder/
```

Use to check for ID collisions before assigning a new `id`.

### Grep [FS] -- ACTIVE
```
grep pattern: "topology"            -- verify topology vocabulary
grep pattern: "communication channel"  -- check channel documentation patterns
grep pattern: "kind: collaboration_pattern"  -- inventory existing patterns
```

### Write [FS] -- ACTIVE
Final delivery tool. Write the completed artifact to its target path under `records/pool/` or
the caller-specified output path.

### Edit [FS] -- ACTIVE
Use during VALIDATE phase to patch specific fields (quality score, updated date, topology type)
without rewriting the full file.

## Data Sources
| Source | Content | When to use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| SCHEMA.md | Field definitions, ID pattern, constraints | Every production run |
| OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md | Exact frontmatter + body structure | Every production run |
| QUALITY_GATES.md | H01-H08 HARD gates | Every validation run |
| KNOWLEDGE.md | Topology types, consensus algorithms, coordination protocols | When designing agent topology |
| MEMORY.md | Common mistakes, anti-patterns | When stuck or producing a variant |
| pool p12_collab_* files | Reference examples | When uncertain about style |

| cex_retriever.py | Discover similar artifacts by TF-IDF | During F3 INJECT |
| cex_doctor.py | Health check builder ISOs | Before dispatch |
