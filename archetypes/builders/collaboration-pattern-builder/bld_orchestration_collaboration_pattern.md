## Crew Role
Facilitates alignment, resolves conflicts, and ensures consistent communication among builders to maintain coherence in collaborative outputs.

## Receives From
| Builder      | What               | Format     |
|--------------|--------------------|------------|
| Design Builder | Design updates     | JSON       |
| Content Builder| Content drafts     | Markdown   |
| Code Builder   | Implementation feedback | Plain text |

## Produces For
| Builder      | What                   | Format     |
|--------------|------------------------|------------|
| All Builders | Coordination plan      | JSON       |
| Stakeholder Manager | Conflict resolution summary | Plain text |
| QA Builder   | Sync validation checklist | Markdown |

## Boundary
Does NOT execute tasks, manage workflows, or define handoff rules. Execution sequence is handled
by workflow builders; handoff rules by handoff_protocol builders; task routing by dispatch_rule
builders.
