# Domain Knowledge: agent
## Executive Summary
An agent is the core runtime identity in an agentic AI system — a persistent persona with scoped capabilities, assigned tools, and a structured file package (agent_package) that makes it portable and searchable. The agent kind defines WHO the LLM becomes when loaded. Every agent requires 10+ spec files covering identity, instructions, examples, error handling, and deployment.
## Spec Table
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Pillar | P02 (identity/model) |
| llm_function | BECOME (identity assumption) |
| Required builder specs | 10 minimum (MANIFEST through SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION) |
| Frontmatter fields | 10 required |
| Quality gates | 7 HARD + 10 SOFT |
| Capability bullets | 4-8 concrete, no vague entries |
| Naming | SPEC_{AGENT_UPPER}_{NNN}_{TYPE}.md |
## Patterns
- **BECOME function**: the LLM reads the agent definition and assumes that identity — persona, constraints, and voice
- **agent package structure**: 10 standardized files per agent enable consistent discovery, loading, and auditing
| Spec File | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| 001_MANIFEST | Identity, version, capabilities |
| 002_QUICK_START | 5-minute onboarding |
| 003_PRIME | Entry point prompt |
| 004_INSTRUCTIONS | Step-by-step execution |
| 005_ARCHITECTURE | Boundary, dependencies |
| 006_OUTPUT_TEMPLATE | Output format with vars |
| 007_EXAMPLES | Golden + anti-examples |
| 008_ERROR_HANDLING | Failure modes |
| 009_UPLOAD_KIT | Deployment guide |
| 010_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION | Full system prompt |
- **Capability scoping**: 4-8 concrete bullets describing what the agent CAN do — no vague "helps with" entries
- **Boundary discipline**: every agent explicitly lists what it does NOT handle, preventing overlap
- **Routing keywords**: 4-8 specific terms that activate this agent via semantic search
## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why it fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| Vague capabilities ("can help with tasks") | No routing signal; brain search returns wrong agent |
| Missing boundary list | Agent scope creep; overlaps with siblings |
| Incomplete agent_package (<10 files) | Agent cannot be fully loaded or audited |
| Identity mixed with task instructions | Conflates WHO (agent) with WHAT (action_prompt) |
| Over-scoped (>8 capabilities) | Agent does too much; should be split |
## Application
1. Define persona: name, domain expertise, voice, constraints
2. Scope capabilities: 4-8 concrete, verifiable bullets
3. Map boundaries: 3-5 sibling types this agent does NOT handle
4. Generate agent_package skeleton (10 files minimum)
5. Write routing keywords for semantic discovery
6. Validate: every capability is testsble, every boundary names a real sibling
