# Instructions: How to Produce an agent
## Phase 1: RESEARCH
1. Identify the agent's primary domain and the specific function it performs within that domain
2. Define the agent's persona: 2-3 sentences describing who this agent is and how it operates
3. List 4-6 capabilities as action verbs (e.g., "analyzes", "generates", "validates", "routes")
4. Identify constraints: what this agent must never do, what it defers to other agents
5. Determine agent_group assignment: which agent_group owns this agent (or mark agnostic)
6. Search for existing agents in the same domain to avoid duplicate definitions
7. List tools required: MCP servers, scripts, APIs, file system paths this agent needs
## Phase 2: COMPOSE
1. Read SCHEMA.md — source of truth for all fields
2. Read OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md — template to fill
3. Fill frontmatter: all 10 required fields (quality: null, never self-score)
4. Set llm_function: BECOME (always for agents, never override)
5. Write Identity section: 2-3 sentences on persona, domain, and primary function
6. Write Capabilities section: 4-6 bullets, each a concrete action this agent performs
7. Write Routing section: keywords and triggers that cause this agent to be selected
8. Write Crew Role section: the question this agent answers, and explicit exclusions
9. Write agent_package skeleton: list 10 minimum builder specs with correct naming convention
10. Set capabilities_count to match actual bullets written
11. Check body <= 5120 bytes
## Phase 3: VALIDATE
1. Check QUALITY_GATES.md manually
2. HARD gate: id matches `p02_agent_` pattern
3. HARD gate: kind == agent
4. HARD gate: quality == null
5. HARD gate: agent_package lists >= 10 files
6. HARD gate: capabilities >= 4 bullets in body
7. HARD gate: llm_function == BECOME
8. HARD gate: agent_group field is set (not blank)
9. Cross-check: is persona expressed only in Identity, not scattered across other sections?
10. Cross-check: do capabilities overlap with any agent assigned to the same agent_group?
11. If score < 8.0: revise before outputting
