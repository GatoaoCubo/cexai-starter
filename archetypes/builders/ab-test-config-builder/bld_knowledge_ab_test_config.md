## Domain Overview  
A/B testing is a cornerstone of conversion optimization, enabling data-driven decisions by comparing variations of user experiences to measure impact on key metrics (e.g., click-through rates, revenue). Proper configuration ensures experiments are statistically valid, reducing bias and ensuring actionable insights. This domain intersects with fields like statistics, UX design, and digital marketing, requiring alignment between technical implementation and business goals.  

Configurations must define hypotheses, traffic allocation, success metrics, and statistical thresholds. Missteps here can lead to invalid conclusions, wasted resources, or ethical concerns (e.g., exposing users to inferior experiences). Industry leaders like Google, Amazon, and Facebook rely on rigorous A/B testing frameworks to optimize user engagement and monetization.

| Statistical Power    | Probability of detecting an effect if it exists (typically ≥80%).         | "Practical Guide to A/B Testing" (Optimizely, 2022)                   |  
| p-value              | Probability of observing results under the null hypothesis (usually <0.05).| ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (2017)    |

## Industry Standards  
- W3C User Experience Testing Standard (2018)  
- IAB A/B Testing Guidelines (2020)  
- Google Optimize Documentation (2023)  
- Optimizely Experimentation Framework (2021)  
- Facebook’s Statistical Methods for A/B Testing (2019)  
- ACM SIGCHI Conference Papers on UX Testing  
- ISO/IEC 25010:2011 Software Quality Requirements  

## Common Patterns  
1. Control Group Baseline: Always include a control group for comparison.  
2. Hypothesis-Driven Variations: Align variations to specific, measurable hypotheses.  
3. Randomized Assignment: Use stratified randomization to balance covariates.  
4. Metric Alignment: Define success metrics upfront and avoid post-hoc adjustments.  
5. Duration-Based Stopping Rules: Set fixed experiment durations to prevent premature termination.  
6. Funnel Analysis Integration: Track conversion funnels to identify drop-off points.  

## Pitfalls  
- Underpowered Tests: Insufficient sample sizes lead to inconclusive results.  
- Confounding Variables: Uncontrolled factors (e.g., seasonality) skew outcomes.  
- Premature Stopping: Halting experiments early increases false positive risks.  
- Biased Sampling: Non-random user allocation introduces selection bias.  
- Ignoring Statistical Significance: Acting on non-significant results wastes resources.
