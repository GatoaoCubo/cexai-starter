# Architecture: signal in the CEX
## Component Inventory
| Name | Role | Owner | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| frontmatter block | Minimal metadata (id, kind, pillar, emitter, status, timestamp) | signal-builder | active |
| status_field | Signal type: complete, error, or progress | emitter | active |
| payload | Minimal JSON body with score, message, and optional extensions | emitter | active |
| emitter_id | Identifier of the agent_group or agent that produced the signal | emitter | active |
| timestamp | ISO 8601 timestamp of emission | system | active |
| extensions | Optional additional fields without breaking consumer contracts | emitter | active |
## Dependency Graph
```
agent_group/agent  --emits-->     signal  --consumed_by-->  orchestrator
signal           --consumed_by-->  monitor  --triggers-->  workflow_step
signal           --signals-->      downstream_action
```
| From | To | Type | Data |
|------|----|------|------|
| agent_group/agent (P02) | signal | produces | emitter creates signal on task completion or error |
| signal | orchestrator | consumes | orchestrator reads signals to track agent_group status |
| signal | monitor | consumes | monitoring system aggregates signals for dashboards |
| signal | workflow_step (P12) | data_flow | signal triggers next step in multi-step workflow |
| signal | downstream_action | signals | cascading action triggered by signal reception |
| spawn_config (P12) | signal | dependency | spawn config defines expected signal patterns |
## Boundary Table
| signal IS | signal IS NOT |
|-----------|---------------|
| An atomic status event between agents (complete, error, progress) | A full instruction set for a task (handoff P12) |
| Minimal JSON payload with low overhead | A routing policy or dispatch rule (dispatch_rule P12) |
| Emitted once per event — fire and forget | A persistent state that evolves over time |
| Consumed by orchestrators and monitors | A multi-step execution flow (workflow P12) |
| Extensible via optional fields without breaking consumers | A schema-heavy artifact requiring full validation |
| Timestamped and attributed to a specific emitter | An anonymous or unattributed event |
## Layer Map
| Layer | Components | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Emission | agent_group/agent, emitter_id, timestamp | Identify who emitted the signal and when |
| Payload | status_field, payload, extensions | Carry the signal data with optional extensions |
| Consumption | orchestrator, monitor | Read and react to signals |
| Cascading | workflow_step, downstream_action | Trigger subsequent actions based on signal content |
