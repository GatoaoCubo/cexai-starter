# MovieReview-Clean
## Summary
A curated dataset of 50,000 English-language movie reviews for sentiment analysis.
## Data Collection
Data was scraped from public IMDB forums between 2022 and 2023. All PII was removed during ingestion.
## Data Structure
- `review_text`: string (The raw text of the review)
- `label`: integer (0 for negative, 1 for positive)
- `timestamp`: datetime (Date of the review)
## Limitations
The dataset contains a bias toward modern films (post-2010) and does not represent non-English cinema.
## Usage
Intended for training binary classifiers for sentiment detection.
## Why it fails:
(N/A - This is the correct format)
## Anti-Example 1: Including evaluation metrics (eval_dataset)
---
id: sentiment_model_eval
type: eval_dataset
---
# Model Performance Report
The BERT-base model achieved an F1-score of 0.89 on the test split.
## Metrics
- Accuracy: 91%
- Precision: 0.88
- Recall: 0.90
## Why it fails:
This is an `eval_dataset` artifact. It focuses on model performance, metrics, and evaluation results rather than documenting the structure, provenance, and features of the underlying dataset.
## Anti-Example 2: Providing factual information (knowledge_card)
---
id: photosynthesis_info
type: knowledge_card
---
# Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is the process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy.
## Key Components
- Chlorophyll
- Sunlight
- Carbon Dioxide
## Why it fails:
This is a `knowledge_card`. It provides general factual information and encyclopedic knowledge about a topic, rather than documenting a structured dataset's metadata, features, or collection methods.

### H_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (HARD)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (min 3 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream or sibling reference
- Gate: REJECT if < 3 entries (auto-populated by cex_wikilink.py at F6.5)

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
