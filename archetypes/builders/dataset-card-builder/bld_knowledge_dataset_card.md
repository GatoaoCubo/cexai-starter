## Domain Overview
Dataset cards serve as the fundamental layer of transparency in the Machine Learning Lifecycle (MLOps). They provide the necessary metadata, provenance, and ethical context required to ensure that datasets are used responsibly, reproducibly, and legally within production environments.

As AI regulations like the EU AI Act emerge, structured documentation becomes a compliance requirement. A well-structured card enables data scientists to audit for bias, understand data lineage, and assess the suitability of a dataset for specific downstream tasks, mitigating risks associated with model failure and data leakage.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Definition | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Provenance | Origin and lineage of data | Data Governance |
| Schema | Structural format and types | Data Engineering |
| Annotation | Process of labeling data | ML Operations |
| Bias | Systematic error in distribution | AI Ethics |
| PII | Personally Identifiable Information | Privacy Compliance |
| Sampling | Method of data selection | Statistics |
| Class Imbalance | Disparity in label frequency | ML Theory |
| Data Drift | Changes in input distribution | MLOps |
| License | Legal usage permissions | Legal/Compliance |
| Preprocessing | Cleaning and transformation | Data Pipeline |

## Industry Standards
- Datasheets for Datasets (Gebru et al.)
- Model Cards for Model Reporting (Mitchell et al.)
- ISO/IEC 5259 (Data quality for AI)
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework

## Common Patterns
1. Lineage-Centric: Documenting every transformation step from raw to processed.
2. Risk-Focused: Explicitly highlighting known gaps or demographic imbalances.
3. Schema-Integrated: Embedding structural constraints within the documentation.
4. Version-Locked: Mapping documentation to specific data hashes or tags.

## Pitfalls
- Omitting the data collection methodology.
- Failing to document the labeling instructions or guidelines.
- Neglecting to disclose potential privacy or PII risks.
- Providing outdated documentation that does not match the current data version.
