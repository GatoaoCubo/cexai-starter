## Crew Role  
Designs and manages non-interactive product tours to educate users on key features without sales or activation focus.  

## Receives From  
| Builder     | What                  | Format      |  
|-------------|-----------------------|-------------|  
| Content Team| Feature descriptions  | Markdown    |  
| Design Team | Visual assets         | PNG/SVG     |  
| Engineering | Technical constraints | JSON spec   |  

## Produces For  
| Builder     | What                  | Format      |  
|-------------|-----------------------|-------------|  
| Engineering | Tour implementation   | JSON        |  
| Design Team | Storyboard            | Figma       |  
| Support Team| User guide            | PDF         |  

## Boundary  
Does NOT handle interactive demos (sales) or onboarding flows (activation). Interactive demos are managed by `interactive_demo-builder`; onboarding flows by `onboarding_flow-builder`. Technical implementation is handled by Engineering, not this builder.
