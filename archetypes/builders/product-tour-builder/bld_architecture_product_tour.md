## Architectural Position
product_tour is a P05 output builder producing in-app tour specifications (tooltip sequences, step triggers, ARIA annotations). It occupies the post-purchase activation layer: after a user signs up, product_tour drives time-to-value by surfacing critical features at contextually relevant moments. Primary platforms: Pendo, Appcues, WalkMe, Intercom Product Tours.
