## Examples

## Golden Example
```markdown
---
title: "Tour: Analytics Dashboard Features"
kind: product_tour
vendor: Pendo
description: "Guided walkthrough of key analytics dashboard features for new users"
---
**Steps:**
1. **Step 1: Filter Bar**
   - Trigger: User clicks "Add Filter" button
   - Tooltip: "Use this bar to narrow down data by date, region, or user segment"
2. **Step 2: Visualization Panel**
   - Trigger: User hovers over chart
   - Tooltip: "Click to edit chart type (bar, line, pie) or export as PNG"
3. **Step 3: Export Options**
   - Trigger: User clicks "Export" dropdown
   - Tooltip: "Download data as CSV, PDF, or share via email"
```

## Anti-Example 1: Confusing with onboarding_flow
```markdown
---
title: "Tour: First Login Setup"
kind: onboarding_flow
vendor: Intercom
description: "Walkthrough for completing user profile during first login"
---
**Steps:**
1. **Step 1: Name Input**
   - Trigger: User arrives at profile page
   - Tooltip: "Enter your full name to personalize your experience"
```
## Why it fails
Mixes product tour with onboarding_flow (activation). Product tours focus on feature discovery, not account setup.

## Anti-Example 2: Missing trigger logic
```markdown
---
title: "Tour: Collaboration Tools"
kind: product_tour
vendor: UserGuiding
description: "Showcase collaboration features"
---
**Steps:**
1. **Step 1: Comment Section**
   - Tooltip: "Add comments to specific data points for team discussion"
```
## Why it fails
No trigger defined - the tour cannot be activated automatically or contextually. Triggers are essential for timed or event-based tours.

### H_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (HARD)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (min 3 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream or sibling reference
- Gate: REJECT if < 3 entries (auto-populated by cex_wikilink.py at F6.5)

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
