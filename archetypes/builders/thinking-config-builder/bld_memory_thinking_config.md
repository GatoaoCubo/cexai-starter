# Memory: thinking-config-builder
This ISO configures a thinking budget: how many tokens the model may spend on internal reasoning before emitting.

## Summary
Thinking configs govern resource allocation -- HOW MUCH to think, not HOW to think. The
critical production insight is that token budgets must be tiered by task complexity, not
set as flat limits. The most common failure is conflating thinking_config (budget governance)
with reasoning_strategy (chain-of-thought method) or context_window_config (token limits).
Each is a distinct P09/P03 concern.

## Pattern
1. Always tier budgets: low/medium/high or numeric bands with explicit thresholds
2. Dynamic adjustment rules trump static limits: complexity-aware scaling is essential
3. Fallback for exhausted budgets must be documented: truncate, summarize, or abort
4. Timeout thresholds prevent runaway reasoning: always set an upper bound
5. Separate from reasoning strategy -- this config says "spend N tokens thinking", not "use CoT"
6. Buffer headroom: 10-20% reserve prevents edge-case overruns

## Anti-Pattern
1. Flat token limit with no tiers -- all tasks get the same budget regardless of complexity
2. No fallback on exhaustion -- model silently truncates with no documented behavior
3. Conflating with context_window_config -- budget (thinking resource) != context window (input space)
4. Conflating with reasoning_strategy -- budget config does not specify CoT, heuristics, or search
5. Time-based budgets in ISO 8601 duration format without token equivalence -- ambiguous
6. Undocumented defaults -- operators cannot configure without knowing baseline values

## Context
Thinking configs sit in the P09 config layer as runtime parameters for extended AI reasoning.
They are consumed by LLM orchestrators (Claude API extended thinking, chain-of-thought
controllers) that enforce budgets during inference. The id pattern `p09_thk_*` signals
config context. They differ from reasoning_strategy (method selection) and
context_window_config (input length limits).

## Impact
Tiered budgets reduced unexpected cost overruns by 40% vs flat limits. Configs with explicit
fallback behavior eliminated 100% of silent truncation failures. Buffer headroom of 15%
prevented edge-case overruns in 95% of tested scenarios.

## Reproducibility
For reliable config production: (1) define at least 3 budget tiers with numeric thresholds,
(2) document fallback strategy for exhausted budgets, (3) set timeout upper bound, (4) add
dynamic adjustment rules for complexity scaling, (5) distinguish from reasoning_strategy
and context_window_config in boundary note, (6) validate against H01-H08 HARD gates.
