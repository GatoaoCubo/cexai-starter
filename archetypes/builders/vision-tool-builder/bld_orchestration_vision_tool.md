# Collaboration: vision-tool-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "what visual inputs does this tool accept, and what structured data does it return?"
I do not build browser automations. I do not control the screen. I do not ingest documents without visual analysis.
I specify visual processing tools so agents and pipelines can extract structured data from images and documents.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Document Intelligence"
```
  1. vision-tool-builder  -> "OCR + layout + table extraction spec"
  2. input-schema-builder -> "input validation for image payloads"
  3. formatter-builder    -> "output formatting (json/table normalization)"
```
### Crew: "Visual Pipeline"
```
  1. vision-tool-builder  -> "visual analysis tool spec"
  2. parser-builder       -> "parse structured JSON from vision output"
  3. db-connector-builder -> "persist extracted data to storage"
```
### Crew: "Multi-Modal Agent"
```
  1. vision-tool-builder  -> "image analysis capability spec"
  2. agent-builder        -> "agent that invokes vision tool on inputs"
  3. hook-builder         -> "pre/post hooks around vision calls"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: visual task description, input source (camera, upload, screenshot), expected output
- optional: provider preference, confidence requirements, supported format list
### I Produce
- vision_tool artifact (.md + .yaml frontmatter)
- committed to: `cex/P04/examples/p04_vision_{name}.md`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with specific gate failures
## Builders I Depend On
None — independent builder (layer 0). Vision tools can be defined standalone.
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| agent-builder | Agents invoke vision tools to process images in their workflow |
| hook-builder | Hooks may trigger vision analysis on file upload or screenshot events |
| instruction-builder | Recipes reference vision tools as extraction steps |
| parser-builder | Parsers consume the structured JSON output of vision tools |
## Boundary Enforcement
| Request | My response |
|---------|-------------|
| "Build tool to click buttons in screenshot" | Redirect to computer-use-builder (screen control) |
| "Scrape text from webpage DOM" | Redirect to browser-tool-builder (DOM interaction) |
| "Load PDF into context without analysis" | Redirect to document-loader-builder (file ingestion) |
| "Search for images on the web" | Redirect to search-tool-builder (web search) |
