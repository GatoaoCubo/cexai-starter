## Architectural Position
team_charter occupies the governance layer of P12 (Orchestration). It sits ABOVE dispatch_rule and handoff (implementation layer) and BELOW the N07 orchestrator (meta-governance layer). The charter is the bridge between the GDP co-pilot phase (user decisions) and the autonomous execution phase (nucleus dispatch). Without a charter, nuclei have no authorized scope boundary; with a charter, N07 can enforce budget, quality, and termination constraints without user re-engagement.

## Data Flow
```
GDP Decision Manifest  -->  team_charter_builder  -->  team_charter artifact
crew_template_ref      -->  (validates capability fit)  |
                                                         v
                                             N07 dispatch (handoffs reference charter)
                                                         |
                                             Nuclei execute within charter constraints
                                                         |
                                             Termination criteria evaluated by N07
