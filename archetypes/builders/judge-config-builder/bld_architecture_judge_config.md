## Architectural Position  
judge_config acts as the central orchestrator in the CEX P07 ecosystem, ensuring consistency, quality, and alignment across configuration judgment processes. It integrates builder ISOs to define, validate, and execute configuration rules, while leveraging external tools for parsing and validation, positioning it as the backbone of structured decision-making in P07.
