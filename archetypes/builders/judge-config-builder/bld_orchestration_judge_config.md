## Crew Role  
Defines and maintains judge configuration parameters, rules, and constraints for consistent evaluation.  

## Receives From  
| Builder       | What                  | Format  |  
|---------------|-----------------------|---------|  
| config_spec   | Configuration spec    | YAML    |  
| judge_spec    | Judge instance spec   | JSON    |  
| ruleset       | Evaluation rules      | YAML    |  

## Produces For  
| Builder       | What                      | Format  |  
|---------------|---------------------------|---------|  
| judge_config  | Judge configuration file  | YAML    |  
| config_report | Validation report         | JSON    |  
| config_schema | Configuration schema      | JSON    |  

## Boundary  
Does NOT handle LLM judge instances (llm_judge) or human-generated rubrics (scoring_rubric). LLM judge instances are managed by llm_judge, and rubrics are handled by scoring_rubric.
