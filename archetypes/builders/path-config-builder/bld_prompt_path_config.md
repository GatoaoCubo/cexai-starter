## Context
The path-config-builder receives a **system scope** and produces a `path_config` artifact that formally specifies all filesystem paths used within that scope, including platform variants, resolution rules, and startup validation.
**Input variables**:
- `{{scope}}` — name of the subsystem or feature that owns these paths (e.g., `logging`, `plugin_storage`, `artifact_cache`)
- `{{platforms}}` — list of target platforms: `[windows, linux, macos]` or `[cross-platform]`
- `{{path_purposes}}` — named paths with their purpose (e.g., `log_dir: stores runtime log files`)
- `{{base_dir}}` — optional root directory from which relative paths resolve (e.g., `~`, `$APPDATA`, `/var`)
- `{{constraints}}` — optional platform-specific rules (Windows max path 260 chars, Linux case-sensitivity, etc.)
**Output**: a single `path_config` artifact at `p09_path_`{{scope}}`.md` listing all paths with per-platform values, resolution type, and validation rules.
**Boundaries**: handles filesystem paths only. Does NOT define non-path environment variables (env_config), access control for directories (permission-builder), feature toggles (feature_flag), or timeout/retry settings (runtime_rule).
## Phases
### Phase 1: RESEARCH
**Goal**: Enumerate every path needed by the scope and classify each one before writing anything.
1. Identify the scope: confirm it is one of `global`, `agent_group name`, or `service name`. Record as a snake_case lowercase slug with no hyphens.
2. List every filesystem path from `{{path_purposes}}`. For each, determine:
   - **Type**: `dir` (container) or `file` (specific file, include extension)
   - **Platform**: `windows`, `unix`, or `all`
   - **Necessity**: `required` (system fails without it) or `optional` (feature degrades gracefully)
   - **Creation policy**: `must_exist`, `create_if_absent`, or `warn_if_absent`
3. Identify parent-child relationships: which paths are subdirectories of another path in the list?
4. Build the directory hierarchy tree (ASCII art). Parent paths must appear before children.
5. Determine `{{base_dir}}`. If not provided, infer from platform defaults:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\`{{scope}} or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\{{scope}}`
   - Linux/macOS: `$HOME/.`{{scope}} or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/{{scope}}`
6. Flag any path that conflicts with OS-reserved directories (`C:\Windows`, `/etc`, `/proc`, `/sys`).
7. Confirm scope slug for `id`: must match `^p09_path_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$`.
8. Search for existing path_config artifacts via brain_query [IF MCP]: `path_config {{scope}}`. Avoid duplicates.
**Exit**: every named path has type, platform, necessity, and creation policy assigned. Directory hierarchy is built. No OS-reserved conflicts unaddressed.
### Phase 2: COMPOSE
**Goal**: Produce all artifact fields, platform variants, resolution rules, and validation sequence.
9. Read SCHEMA.md — source of truth for all required fields.
10. Read OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md — fill `{{vars}}` following SCHEMA constraints exactly.
11. Fill frontmatter: all required fields. Set `quality: null` — never self-score.
12. Set `scope` to the concrete slug from Phase 1 step 1.
13. Write `paths` list with exact names matching the Path Catalog table (zero drift between frontmatter list and body table).
14. Write **Overview** section: 1–2 sentences on scope, purpose, and consumers.
15. Write **Path Catalog** section: table with columns `name | type | platform | default | required | notes`. Use expandable variables in default values (e.g., `%APPDATA%\logs`) — never hardcode user-specific absolute paths.
16. Write **Directory Hierarchy** section: ASCII tree showing parent-child relationships.
17. Write **Platform Notes** section: document separator differences (`\` Windows vs `/` Unix), environment variable expansion per platform, and the cross-platform resolution priority:
    - Priority 1: environment variable override (e.g., `APP_LOG_DIR`)
    - Priority 2: platform default
    - Priority 3: fallback relative path from executable directory
18. For dynamic paths, specify the resolution expression: `env("APP_`{{PATH_NAME_UPPER}}`") ?? platform_default("`{{path_value}}`")`.
19. Write **Startup Validation** sequence as an ordered list. Required paths with `must_exist` get `assert isdir/isfile`. Paths with `create_if_absent` get mkdir command. Parent paths appear before children.
20. Verify body <= 3072 bytes.
**Exit**: `paths` list in frontmatter matches path names in Path Catalog table exactly. Body within byte limit. No hardcoded user-specific absolute paths.
### Phase 3: VALIDATE
**Goal**: Verify all quality gates before writing the final artifact.
21. Check QUALITY_GATES.md — verify each HARD gate manually.
22. Confirm YAML frontmatter parses without errors.
23. Confirm `paths` list in frontmatter matches path names in Path Catalog (zero drift).
24. Confirm `quality == null`.
25. Confirm body has all 4 required sections: Overview, Path Catalog, Directory Hierarchy, Platform Notes.
26. Confirm no user-specific absolute paths — only expandable variables.
27. Confirm body <= 3072 bytes.
28. Verify no path value on Windows exceeds 260 characters.
