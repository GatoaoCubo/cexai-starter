## Component Inventory
| Name | Role | Owner | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| frontmatter block | Metadata header (id, kind, pillar, domain, target_kind, dimensions_count, etc.) | scoring-rubric-builder | active |
| dimensions | Named evaluation axes with descriptions and rationale | author | active |
| weights | Percentage weight per dimension (must sum to 100%) | author | active |
| scale_definitions | Per-dimension scoring scale with concrete criteria at each level | author | active |
| tier_thresholds | Score ranges mapped to quality tiers (master, skilled, learning, rejected) | author | active |
| calibration_refs | Golden test references used to anchor consistent scoring | author | active |
| automation_status | Which dimensions are automated, semi-automated, or manual | author | active |
## Dependency Graph
```
domain_knowledge  --produces-->  scoring_rubric  --consumed_by-->  quality_gate

scoring_rubric    --signals-->   calibration_drift
```
| From | To | Type | Data |
|------|----|------|------|
| knowledge_card (P01) | scoring_rubric | data_flow | domain expertise informing dimension selection |
| golden_test (P07) | scoring_rubric | data_flow | reference examples for scoring calibration |
| scoring_rubric | quality_gate (P11) | consumes | gate uses rubric criteria for scoring decisions |
| scoring_rubric | evaluator | consumes | human or automated evaluator applies the rubric |
| scoring_rubric | calibration_drift (P12) | signals | emitted when inter-rater agreement drops |
| benchmark (P07) | scoring_rubric | dependency | benchmarks may inform threshold selection |
## Boundary Table
| scoring_rubric IS | scoring_rubric IS NOT |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| An evaluation framework with weighted dimensions and tiers | A reference example of ideal output (golden_test P07) |
| Defines how quality is measured with concrete criteria | A pass/fail quality barrier (quality_gate P11) |
| Dimensions sum to 100% weight for balanced scoring | A technical validation rule (validator P06) |
| Calibrated against golden tests for consistency | A performance measurement (benchmark P07) |
| Scoped to one artifact kind with kind-specific criteria | A universal evaluation applicable to all kinds |
| Supports manual, semi-automated, and automated evaluation | An exclusively automated check without human option |
## Layer Map
| Layer | Components | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Domain | knowledge_card, benchmark | Supply domain expertise and performance baselines |
| Framework | frontmatter, dimensions, weights | Define evaluation axes and their relative importance |
| Criteria | scale_definitions, tier_thresholds | Specify concrete scoring levels and quality tiers |
| Calibration | calibration_refs, golden_test | Anchor consistent scoring with reference examples |
| Application | quality_gate, evaluator, automation_status | Apply the rubric in automated or manual evaluation |
