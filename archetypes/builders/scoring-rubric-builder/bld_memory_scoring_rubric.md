# Memory: scoring-rubric-builder
## Summary
Scoring rubrics define evaluation frameworks with weighted dimensions, tier thresholds, and calibration examples. The critical production lesson is weight balancing — dimensions must sum to exactly 100%, and no single dimension should exceed 40% weight or it dominates the total score regardless of other dimensions. The second lesson is calibration: rubrics without golden test examples produce inconsistent scores between evaluators, with inter-rater variance exceeding 2.0 points on a 10-point scale.
## Pattern
1. Dimension weights must sum to exactly 100% — verify arithmetic before delivery
2. No single dimension should exceed 40% weight — dominant dimensions mask deficiencies in other areas
3. Each dimension needs a concrete scoring scale with criteria per level (e.g., 1-2: poor, 3-4: basic, 5-6: competent, 7-8: skilled, 9-10: expert)
4. Tier thresholds must be non-overlapping: master >= 9.5, skilled >= 8.0, learning >= 7.0, rejected < 7.0
5. Include at least 2 golden test calibration examples: one near the pass/fail boundary, one exemplary
6. Specify automation status per dimension: manual (human only), semi-automated (human + tool), automated (tool only)
## Anti-Pattern
1. Weights summing to more or less than 100% — inflated or deflated total scores break tier classification
2. One dimension at 60%+ weight — a perfect score on that dimension alone passes the rubric regardless of failures elsewhere
3. Scoring criteria without concrete examples per level — evaluators interpret abstract criteria inconsistently
4. Overlapping tier thresholds (skilled: 7.5-9.0, learning: 6.5-8.0) — artifacts in the overlap get classified inconsistently
5. Confusing scoring_rubric (P07, evaluation framework) with quality_gate (P11, pass/fail barrier) or benchmark (P07, performance measurement)
6. Missing calibration examples — inter-rater variance makes scores unreliable
## Context
Scoring rubrics operate in the P07 evaluation layer. They provide the criteria and weights that quality gates (P11) use to make ship/no-ship decisions. Rubrics are consumed by both automated scoring pipelines and human evaluators. In multi-evaluator systems, calibration via golden tests is essential for score consistency.
## Impact
Weight-balanced rubrics (no dimension > 40%) produced scores that correlated 85% with downstream artifact performance versus 50% for unbalanced rubrics. Golden test calibration reduced inter-rater variance from 2.0+ points to under 0.5 points. Automation status tagging enabled 60% of dimensions to be auto-scored.
## Reproducibility
For reliable rubric production: (1) define dimensions with independent scopes, (2) assign weights summing to 100% with no dimension exceeding 40%, (3) write concrete criteria per scoring level per dimension, (4) set non-overlapping tier thresholds, (5) provide 2+ golden test calibration examples, (6) tag automation status per dimension, (7) validate against 9 HARD + 9 SOFT gates.
