## Domain Overview
The EdTech vertical covers digital tools for K-12, higher education, and corporate L&D. The compliance stack is layered: FERPA (student records privacy), COPPA (under-13 consent), and CIPA (internet filtering for K-12 schools receiving E-rate funding). Integration is dominated by LTI 1.3 -- the IMS Global standard used by Canvas, Moodle, Blackboard, and Google Classroom. Learning analytics use either xAPI (Experience API, formerly SCORM successor) or IMS Caliper 1.2.

District procurement is a significant barrier: most K-12 districts require state ed-tech approval list inclusion or ISTE Product Certification before district-wide purchases. ACVs range $30K-$150K per district. Higher Ed procurement is faster (VP Academic Technology decision) but requires Canvas/Moodle certification and an EDUCAUSE membership.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Definition | Source |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| FERPA | Protects educational records of K-12 and Higher Ed students; requires parental consent for disclosure | 20 USC 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99 |
| COPPA | Requires verifiable parental consent before collecting PII from children under 13 | 15 USC 6501; FTC 16 CFR Part 312 |
| CIPA | Mandates internet filtering for K-12 schools receiving E-rate; applies to devices and networks | 47 USC 254(h) |
| LTI 1.3 | IMS Global standard for LMS tool integration; uses OAuth 2.0 + IMS Security Framework v1.0 | IMS Global LTI 1.3 Spec |
| xAPI (Experience API) | Learning activity tracking standard; captures statements (actor-verb-object) to LRS | ADL Initiative / 1EdTech |
| IMS Caliper 1.2 | Sensor API for learning event data; event profiles include Assessment, Media, Session | 1EdTech (formerly IMS Global) |
| 1EdTech | Standards body (formerly IMS Global); maintains LTI, xAPI, QTI, Common Cartridge | 1edtech.org |
| ISTE Product Certification | EdTech product quality certification by ISTE; frequently required in district procurement | ISTE.org |
| SIS Integration | Student Information System sync (PowerSchool, Infinite Campus); roster data via OneRoster 1.2 | 1EdTech OneRoster |
| EDUCAUSE | Higher Ed IT association; EduPerson attribute standard for campus identity federation | EDUCAUSE.edu |

## Industry Standards
- FERPA (20 USC 1232g) + 34 CFR Part 99 -- studentprivacy.ed.gov
- COPPA (15 USC 6501) + FTC 16 CFR Part 312
- CIPA (47 USC 254(h)) -- E-rate filtering requirement
- LTI 1.3 + IMS Security Framework v1.0 (imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3)
- xAPI (Experience API) 1.0.3 -- adlnet.gov/projects/xapi
- IMS Caliper 1.2 (1edtech.org/activity/caliper)
- 1EdTech OneRoster 1.2 (roster/grade sync)
- ISTE Product Certification (district procurement qualification)
- ISO/IEC 27001 (information security management -- for enterprise EdTech)

## Common Patterns
1. LTI 1.3 with IMS Security Framework v1.0 is the minimum integration requirement for Canvas, Moodle, and Blackboard -- earlier versions (LTI 1.1) are being deprecated.
2. COPPA requires a "verifiable parental consent" mechanism -- email to parent + wait for consent is not sufficient; phone, signed form, or credit card verification is required by FTC.
3. FERPA school official exception: vendors processing student data under DUSA (Data Use and Sharing Agreement) qualify as "school officials" -- this is the standard SaaS EdTech contract model.
4. xAPI LRS (Learning Record Store) must be configured to receive statements; Watershed, SCORM Cloud, and Learning Locker are common LRS choices.
5. State ed-tech approval list inclusion (e.g., Texas TEA, California IIPPI) typically requires ISTE certification + FERPA/COPPA compliance documentation + data privacy agreement.
6. OneRoster 1.2 is the dominant roster sync standard replacing CSV-based SIS imports; reduces onboarding time from weeks to hours.

## Pitfalls
- Using LTI 1.1 (deprecated) -- Canvas removing support in 2025; will break all tool launches.
- COPPA "soft consent" (unchecked checkbox) -- FTC treats this as no consent; class action risk.
- Collecting learning analytics without xAPI/Caliper standard -- district data audits will require export in standard format.
- Missing ISTE Product Certification -- blocks entry into most state ed-tech approval lists.
- FERPA records disclosure without signed DUSA -- every school requires this before first student data transfer.
- Treating "educational use" as automatic COPPA exemption -- COPPA applies even to educational contexts for under-13 users.
