## Crew Role  
Builds executable SDK examples by translating API specs into code, ensuring compatibility and correctness.  

## Receives From  
| Builder       | What              | Format      |  
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|  
| API Spec Team | API definition    | YAML        |  
| Config Team   | SDK config file   | JSON        |  
| User          | Example scenario   | Text file   |  

## Produces For  
| Builder       | What              | Format      |  
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|  
| SDK Consumer  | SDK example code  | Python      |  
| QA Team       | Test case         | Code        |  
| Docs Team     | Doc snippet       | Markdown    |  

## Boundary
