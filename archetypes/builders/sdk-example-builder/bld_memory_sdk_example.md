## Observation
Common issues include inconsistent error handling, lack of parameter validation, and unclear documentation in example code. Language-specific nuances often lead to redundant boilerplate or misaligned integration patterns.

## Pattern
Canonical examples prioritize idiomatic language usage, modular code structure, and explicit documentation. They abstract boilerplate into reusable components while exposing core SDK functionality clearly.

## Evidence
Reviewed Python and JavaScript examples showed consistent error handling via exceptions and clear function signatures, respectively.

## Recommendations
- Standardize error handling (e.g., exceptions, result objects) per language.
- Include parameter validation and default values in example functions.
- Use comments to demarcate SDK-specific logic vs. user implementation.
- Avoid hardcoding credentials or sensitive data in sample code.
- Provide minimal, self-contained examples that highlight key integration steps.
