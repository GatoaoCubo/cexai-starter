## Domain Overview
SDK examples serve as blueprints for integrating third-party services into applications, abstracting low-level details while exposing idiomatic APIs. They emphasize cross-language interoperability, standardization, and adherence to language-specific best practices (e.g., Python’s async/await, Java’s static imports). Examples often demonstrate REST, gRPC, or messaging patterns, ensuring developers can map business logic to API contracts without reinventing infrastructure.

SDKs must balance simplicity and flexibility, avoiding vendor lock-in while providing sufficient abstractions for common use cases. They frequently incorporate authentication (OAuth 2.0, API keys), error handling (HTTP status codes, retries), and serialization (JSON, Protobuf). The goal is to reduce boilerplate code while maintaining idiomatic language constructs.

## Key Concepts

| RESTful Design        | Client-server architecture with stateless, resource-based interactions     | Fielding’s PhD dissertation     |
| OAuth 2.0             | Delegation protocol for secure API access                                  | RFC 6749                        |
| OpenAPI Specification | Machine-readable API definition format                                     | OpenAPI Initiative              |
| gRPC                  | High-performance RPC framework using HTTP/2 and Protobuf                  | Google’s gRPC documentation     |
| Circuit Breaker       | Pattern to prevent cascading failures in distributed systems               | Martin Fowler’s Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture |
| Dependency Injection  | Technique to decouple SDK components from concrete implementations       | Wikipedia                       |
| JSON:API              | Standard for building JSON-based APIs with consistent resource modeling  | JSON:API.org                    |

## Industry Standards
- OpenAPI Specification (OAS)
- gRPC (HTTP/2 + Protobuf)
- OAuth 2.0 (RFC 6749)
- JSON:API (RFC 8900)
- RESTful Web Services (Fielding’s dissertation)
- Protobuf (Google’s data serialization format)
- RFC 7231 (HTTP/1.1 semantics)
- IEEE 1003.1 (POSIX standards for system calls)

## Common Patterns
1. Idiomatic client creation (e.g., Python’s `requests` vs. Java’s `HttpClient`)
2. Async operations with cancellable futures/promises
3. Error propagation via typed exceptions or status codes
4. Configuration management via environment variables or YAML
5. Dependency injection for mockable HTTP clients

## Pitfalls
- Blocking calls in async SDKs (e.g., using `time.sleep()` in async code)
- Hardcoding API endpoints instead of using configurable URLs
- Ignoring rate limiting or retry policies in error handling
- Overloading SDKs with language-specific abstractions (e.g., Java’s `Optional` in Python)
- Failing to align serialization formats with backend expectations (e.g., JSON vs. Protobuf)
