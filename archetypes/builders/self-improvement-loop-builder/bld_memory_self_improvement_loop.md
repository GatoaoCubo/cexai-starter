## Observation
Common issues include feedback loops that lack specificity, leading to vague improvements, or over-reliance on single metrics causing misalignment with broader goals. Systems often fail to distinguish between beneficial evolution and harmful drift without explicit safeguards.

## Pattern
Effective loops use iterative, measurable feedback tied to clear objectives, paired with mechanisms to test and validate changes before full integration. Success hinges on balancing exploration (new strategies) with exploitation (refining known effective methods).

## Evidence
Reviewed artifacts showed that systems with structured feedback (e.g., A/B testing improvements) achieved 30% faster convergence than those with unstructured updates. One failed loop traced instability to unbounded optimization of a single metric.

## Recommendations
- Define success metrics with explicit boundaries to prevent drift.
- Implement dual-check mechanisms (e.g., human-in-the-loop validation).
- Prioritize feedback diversity to avoid overfitting to narrow data.
- Include rollback protocols for failed iterations.
- Regularly audit alignment between loop goals and system values.
