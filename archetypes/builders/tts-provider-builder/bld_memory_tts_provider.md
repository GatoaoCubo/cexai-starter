## Observation  
Common issues include inconsistent API handling across providers, leading to duplicated code, and misaligned audio format support (e.g., WAV vs. MP3). Configuration mismatches often cause runtime errors during synthesis.  

## Pattern  
Modular design with provider-specific adapters improves maintainability. Centralized configuration management ensures consistent parameter handling across different TTS backends.  

## Evidence  
Reviewed artifacts using `tts_provider_builder` with AWS Polly and Azure Cognitive Services showed reduced duplication via interface abstraction and config-driven initialization.  

## Recommendations  
- Define strict interfaces for provider-specific operations (e.g., `synthesize_text()`).  
- Use configuration files to decouple provider parameters from implementation logic.  
- Validate audio format compatibility during artifact construction.  
- Implement fallback mechanisms for unsupported features in legacy providers.  
- Document required parameters per provider to avoid runtime configuration errors.
