# Collaboration: model-provider-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "how should we connect to and route between LLM providers?"
I produce connection and routing configurations for LLM APIs with tiered model selection, rate limits, fallback chains, and authentication. I do NOT handle model specs (model-card-builder), embedding configs (embedder-provider-builder), agent definitions (agent-builder), or boot configurations (boot-config-builder).
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Setup Multi-Provider LLM Routing"
```
  1. model-provider-builder  -> "provider connection configs for each API (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google)"
  2. model-card-builder      -> "model specs informing tier assignment and cost routing"
  3. router-builder           -> "routing rules: nucleus -> provider -> model selection"
  4. fallback-chain-builder   -> "cross-provider fallback ordering and trigger conditions"
```
### Crew: "Bootstrap New CEX Nucleus"
```
  1. model-provider-builder  -> "provider config for the nucleus's assigned LLM"
  2. model-card-builder      -> "spec for the model powering the nucleus"
  3. boot-config-builder     -> "startup config using provider connection and model params"
  4. system-prompt-builder   -> "persona adapted to assigned model capabilities"
```
### Crew: "Cost Optimization Audit"
```
  1. model-provider-builder  -> "all provider configs with current pricing"
  2. lens-builder            -> "cost/quality perspective for routing optimization"
  3. scoring-rubric-builder  -> "scores each provider-tier combo against task quality"
  4. model-card-builder      -> "capability comparison for tier reassignment"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: provider name, account tier (minimum required)
- optional: nucleus assignment, fallback provider preference, budget constraints
### I Produce
- model_provider artifact (YAML, 22+ frontmatter fields, tiered models, rate limits, fallback chain)
- committed to: `cex/P02_model/examples/p02_mp_{provider}.yaml`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons
## Builders I Depend On
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| model-card-builder | model specs inform tier assignment (which model is fast/balanced/quality) |
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| router-builder         | needs provider configs to build routing rules |
| boot-config-builder    | needs provider API and model ID for nucleus startup |
| fallback-chain-builder | needs provider health and rate limit data for fallback ordering |
| agent-builder          | references provider capabilities in agent definition |
| agent-package-builder  | includes model_provider as a deploy dependency |
