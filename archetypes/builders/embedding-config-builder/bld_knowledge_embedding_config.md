# Domain Knowledge: embedding_config
## Executive Summary
Embedding configs define how text is converted to vectors for semantic search: model selection, dimensions, chunk size, overlap, distance metric, and normalization. They sit in the spec layer — defining MODEL parameters, not index structure (knowledge_index) or data sources (rag_source). The choice of embedding model determines retrieval quality, cost, and latency.
## Spec Table
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Pillar | P01 (knowledge) |
| Frontmatter fields | 20+ |
| Quality gates | 8 HARD + 8 SOFT |
| Default distance metric | cosine (requires normalize=true) |
| Chunk size range | 256-512 (retrieval), 1024+ (summarization) |
| Overlap | 10-20% of chunk_size |
| Key providers | OpenAI, Ollama (local), Cohere, Voyage |
## Patterns
- **Model selection by trade-off**:
| Model | Dimensions | Cost | Quality (MTEB) | Use case |
|-------|-----------|------|----------------|----------|
| text-embedding-3-small | 1536 | $0.02/1M | Good | Budget production |
| text-embedding-3-large | 3072 | $0.13/1M | Best (API) | High-fidelity retrieval |
| nomic-embed-text | 768 | Free (local) | Good | Privacy, zero cost |
| mxbai-embed-large | 1024 | Free (local) | Better (local) | Quality local option |
- **Chunk size balances granularity vs context**: smaller chunks = more precise retrieval but less context per result
- **Overlap prevents boundary loss**: 10-20% overlap ensures information at chunk edges is captured in adjacent chunks
- **Normalization**: required for cosine similarity; skip only when using dot_product distance
- **Batch processing**: larger batches = fewer API calls = lower latency; balance against memory constraints
- **Cost awareness**: track cost_per_1M_tokens; local models (Ollama) trade quality for zero cost
## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why it fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| No chunk overlap | Information at boundaries is lost; queries miss relevant content |
| Cosine without normalization | Distance calculations are incorrect; results unreliable |
| chunk_size > context_window | Chunks truncated silently; information loss |
| Mixing distance metrics | Index built with cosine, searched with dot_product = wrong ranking |
| Over-dimensioned model for simple task | Wastes compute and storage; 768-dim sufficient for most retrieval |
| No cost tracking | API embedding costs accumulate unnoticed |
## Application
1. Select provider: API (OpenAI, Cohere) for quality or local (Ollama) for cost/privacy
2. Choose model: match dimensions and quality to retrieval requirements
3. Set chunk_size: 256-512 for retrieval, 1024+ for summarization
4. Set overlap: 10-20% of chunk_size
5. Configure distance metric: cosine (default, normalize=true) or dot_product
6. Validate: chunks fit model context window, normalization matches distance metric
