## Phase 1: RESEARCH  

This ISO applies to the dual loop pattern, coordinating an outer orchestrator with one or more inner worker loops.
1. Define dual-loop architecture purpose: outer loop for long-term planning, inner loop for real-time execution.  
2. Analyze existing agent control frameworks for compatibility with P08 REASON function.  
3. Identify key components: outer loop (goals, policies), inner loop (sensors, actuators).  
4. Map interaction protocols between loops (e.g., feedback, error correction).  
5. Evaluate trade-offs between loop autonomy and coordination.  
6. Document research findings in schema-compatible format (SCHEMA.md).  

## Phase 2: COMPOSE  
1. Set up artifact directory with subfolders: `outer_loop`, `inner_loop`, `interface`.  
2. Define outer_loop schema: goal states, policy rules, and evaluation metrics.  
3. Define inner_loop schema: sensor inputs, actuator outputs, and error thresholds.  
4. Write outer_loop agent logic using SCHEMA.md-defined policies.  
5. Write inner_loop agent logic with real-time decision trees.  
6. Implement interface layer for bidirectional data flow between loops.  
7. Align artifact structure with OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md section headers.  
8. Add metadata: version, author, and P08 REASON compliance notes.  
9. Finalize code with comments referencing SCHEMA.md and template sections.  

## Phase 3: VALIDATE  
- [ ] ✅ Verify outer/inner loop schemas match SCHEMA.md requirements.  
- [ ] ✅ Confirm interface layer supports all defined data types.  
- [ ] ✅ Test loop autonomy under simulated failure scenarios.  
- [ ] ✅ Validate performance against P08 REASON benchmarks.  
- [ ] ✅ Ensure documentation completeness in OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md.
