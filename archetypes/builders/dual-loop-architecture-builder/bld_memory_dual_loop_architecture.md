## Observation

This ISO applies to the dual loop pattern, coordinating an outer orchestrator with one or more inner worker loops.
Common issues include blurred boundaries between outer/inner loop responsibilities, leading to conflicting objectives, and insufficient feedback mechanisms that hinder adaptive control.

## Pattern
Effective designs decouple decision-making (outer loop) from execution (inner loop), using explicit interfaces and shared state for alignment. Iterative refinement through feedback loops ensures stability and adaptability.

## Evidence
Reviewed artifacts showed success when outer loops prioritized long-term goals while inner loops focused on real-time adjustments, with explicit synchronization points.

## Recommendations
- Define clear, non-overlapping objectives for each loop.
- Implement robust feedback channels with prioritization rules.
- Use modular components to isolate loop-specific logic.
- Validate with stress tests simulating misalignment scenarios.
- Document boundary conditions and failure modes explicitly.
