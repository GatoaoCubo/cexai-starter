## Domain Overview

This ISO applies to the dual loop pattern, coordinating an outer orchestrator with one or more inner worker loops.
Dual-loop architecture is a control paradigm used in robotics, autonomous systems, and industrial automation to separate real-time execution (inner loop) from strategic decision-making (outer loop). The inner loop manages low-latency tasks like motor control and sensor feedback, while the outer loop handles higher-level planning, error correction, and goal adaptation. This separation ensures responsiveness and stability in dynamic environments, such as autonomous vehicle navigation or robotic manipulation.

Industry adoption is driven by the need to balance speed and adaptability. For example, in aerospace, the inner loop ensures flight stability, while the outer loop optimizes trajectory planning. Similarly, in manufacturing, dual-loop systems enable real-time adjustments to production lines while maintaining long-term process goals.

## Industry Standards
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- ISO 26262:2018 (Automotive functional safety)
- IEEE 1878-2017 (Autonomous system standards)
- Model Predictive Control (MPC) frameworks
- IEC 61508 (Functional safety of electrical/electronic systems)

## Common Patterns
1. **Hierarchical task delegation** – Assign distinct responsibilities to each loop.
2. **Feedback-driven adaptation** – Use inner-loop data to refine outer-loop goals.
3. **Latency-aware prioritization** – Allocate resources to time-critical inner-loop tasks.
4. **Hybrid control modes** – Switch between loops based on environmental conditions.

## Pitfalls
- Confusing loop boundaries (e.g., outer-loop decisions violating inner-loop constraints).
- Overloading the outer loop with real-time data, causing delays.
- Ignoring latency in feedback paths, leading to instability.
- Hardcoding loop parameters, reducing adaptability in dynamic environments.
- Poor modularity between loops, complicating maintenance and scaling.
