## Component Inventory

This ISO applies to the dual loop pattern, coordinating an outer orchestrator with one or more inner worker loops.

| Name | Role | Loop | Cadence | Model tier | Status |
|------|------|------|---------|------------|--------|
| InnerLoopRunner | Reactive step executor -- consumes observations, emits actions | inner | tick_ms (50-500ms) | small/fast (Haiku, Sonnet, GPT-4o-mini) | core |
| OuterLoopPlanner | Reflective planner -- revises strategy, critiques trajectory | outer | cadence_s (5-60s) or N ticks | large/reasoning (Opus, o1, R1) | core |
| MemoryBridge | Shared working state: scratchpad + trajectory + plan slot | both | on every tick + planner write | n/a (KV store) | core |
| PlanSlot | Current outer-loop plan -- guides inner loop until replaced | both r / outer w | read hot, write slow | n/a | core |
| Checkpointer | Snapshots (obs, action, reward) triples for replay/critique | inner w | every tick | n/a | core |
| Critic | Scores trajectory, triggers early re-plan if regret > threshold | outer | per cadence | small LLM or rule | optional |
| BridgeQueue | Inbox for outer-loop to push revised plans without stalling inner | both | async | n/a (mpsc channel) | core |
| Governor | Budget tracker: halts outer loop on token/time/cost cap | outer | per cadence | n/a | optional |

## Dependencies

| From | To | Type | Protocol |
|------|----|----|----------|
| InnerLoopRunner | MemoryBridge | sync (read PlanSlot, write trajectory) | in-process ref |
| InnerLoopRunner | Checkpointer | sync (append) | append-only log |
| Checkpointer | OuterLoopPlanner | async (read last N) | ring buffer |
| OuterLoopPlanner | BridgeQueue | async (push new Plan) | mpsc channel |
| BridgeQueue | InnerLoopRunner | async (swap PlanSlot between ticks) | atomic pointer |
| Critic | OuterLoopPlanner | sync (regret signal triggers early wake) | callback |
| Governor | OuterLoopPlanner | sync (halt/resume gate) | semaphore |

## Architectural Position

Dual-loop is a two-tier agent topology that decouples latency from intelligence. The inner loop runs a small model at high frequency (reactive, System-1-like) and must never block on the outer loop. The outer loop runs a large/reasoning model at low frequency (deliberative, System-2-like) and revises the Plan that the inner loop consumes. The MemoryBridge is the ONLY shared state -- no direct calls between loops. This pattern generalizes OODA (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act with Orient/Decide at slow cadence), Reflexion (episodic self-critique), and Skeleton-of-Thought (outline fast, fill in parallel). Sits above agent (P02) and below workflow (P12) in the CEX stack.
