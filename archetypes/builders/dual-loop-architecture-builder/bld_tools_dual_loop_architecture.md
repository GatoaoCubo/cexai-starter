## Runtime Tools (what the produced artifact consumes)

This ISO applies to the dual loop pattern, coordinating an outer orchestrator with one or more inner worker loops.

| Tool | Purpose | When | Owner loop |
|------|---------|------|------------|
| tick_scheduler | Drives InnerLoopRunner at fixed tick_ms cadence; also fires outer cadence_s | boot | both |
| memory_bridge | Read/write shared state: PlanSlot, trajectory, scratchpad | every tick + every plan | both |
| trajectory_log | Append-only ring buffer of (obs, action, reward) for critic/planner | per inner tick | inner w, outer r |
| plan_slot_swap | Atomic pointer swap so inner never reads a half-written plan | on outer plan commit | outer w, inner r |
| critic_fn | Scores trajectory window, emits regret signal to trigger early re-plan | outer cadence or on-demand | outer |
| model_router | Routes inner calls to fast tier (Sonnet/Haiku/mini), outer to reasoning tier (Opus/o1) | every LLM call | both |
| budget_governor | Halts outer loop when token/cost/time cap hit; inner keeps running on last plan | outer cadence | outer |
| signal_bus | mpsc channel for outer -> inner plan pushes and inner -> outer critique asks | async | both |

## Build-time Tools (what the builder uses to PRODUCE the artifact)

| Tool | Purpose | When |
|------|---------|------|
| cex_compile.py | Compile produced .md spec to runnable yaml + stub code | F8 COLLABORATE |
| cex_score.py | 5D quality scoring (density, specificity, correctness, completeness, consistency) | F7 GOVERN |
| cex_retriever.py | Pull similar dual-loop specs + KCs (Reflexion, OODA, SoT) for F3 INJECT | F3 INJECT |
| cex_doctor.py | Check frontmatter, ID pattern p08_dl_*, byte budget, required fields | F7 GOVERN |
| cex_schema_hydrate.py | Expand bld_schema into full frontmatter template | F1 CONSTRAIN |
| signal_writer.py | Emit completion signal with quality score to N07 | F8 COLLABORATE |
