## Crew Role  

This ISO applies to the dual loop pattern, coordinating an outer orchestrator with one or more inner worker loops.
Coordinates dual-loop control systems by maintaining real-time feedback (inner loop) and strategic adaptation (outer loop), ensuring alignment between operational execution and long-term goals.  

## Receives From  
| Builder       | What                  | Format      |  
|---------------|-----------------------|-------------|  
| Inner Loop    | Sensor data           | JSON        |  
| Outer Loop    | Strategic parameters  | YAML        |  
| Monitor       | Performance metrics   | Custom      |  

## Produces For  
| Builder       | What                  | Format      |  
|---------------|-----------------------|-------------|  
| Inner Loop    | Control adjustments   | JSON        |  
| Outer Loop    | Status summaries      | YAML        |  
| Logger        | System diagnostics    | Custom      |  

## Boundary  
Does NOT handle external stakeholder communication (handled by dedicated interface agents) or resource allocation (managed by orchestration layer). Focuses strictly on loop synchronization and control logic.
