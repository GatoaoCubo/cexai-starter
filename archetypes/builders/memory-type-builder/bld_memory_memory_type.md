# Memory: memory-type-builder

## Observations

| # | Date | Type | Confidence | Observation |
|---|------|------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | 2026-04-05 | convention | 0.80 | memory_type builder created during OpenClaude assimilation (Wave 4, T11) |
| 2 | 2026-04-05 | correction | 0.85 | First-pass ISOs had low density (0.67-0.70); tables beat prose for density |
| 3 | 2026-04-05 | pattern | 0.90 | 4-type taxonomy (correction/preference/convention/context) is stable across production systems |

## Patterns

| Pattern | Evidence | Reuse |
|---------|----------|-------|
| New kind sequence: meta -> KC -> ISOs -> doctor | All 300 kinds followed this | Always |
| Tables raise density above 0.78 threshold | Doctor density gate pass rate 100% with tables | When ISO density < 0.78 |
| Enum-driven classification reduces LLM ambiguity | MemoryType enum in cex_memory_types.py | For any categorical kind |
| Decay rates must align between memory_age and memory_update | Linear decay 1yr floor 50% in both modules | When touching memory pipeline |

## Build Context

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Origin | OpenClaude assimilation, pattern harvest from memory system |
| SDK module | `cex_memory_types.py` (MemoryType enum + should_save classifier) |
| Wired at | `cex_memory_update.py` append_observation() |
| Quality gate | Dedup check: reject if cosine similarity > 0.85 with existing observation |
| Failure mode | Missing type = defaults to `context` (safest fallback) |
