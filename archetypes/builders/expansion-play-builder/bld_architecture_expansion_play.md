## Architectural Position
expansion_play serves as the net-new ARR growth engine within CEX P03/P11 commercial layer, translating product usage signals into structured, executable account expansion motions. It bridges the CS (customer success) and AE (account executive) functions, enforcing quantified triggers and NRR accountability across the land-and-expand model used by Snowflake, Datadog, and similar PLG/SLG hybrid vendors.
