## Observation
Expansion plays without quantified triggers consistently fail to reach threshold for execution: CSMs report "not sure when to reach out" and miss the window. Plays with specific thresholds (>80% seat utilization for 14 days) execute on time and at 2x the conversion rate of vague plays.

## Pattern
Trigger specificity is the single highest-leverage quality dimension. A play with a precise trigger and a weak talk track outperforms a plan with a strong talk track and a vague trigger, because the precise trigger ensures the play is executed at the right moment.

## Evidence
- Analysis of 47 expansion plays: plays with quantified triggers had 68% execution rate vs. 31% for vague triggers.
- NRR model completeness correlates with VP-level buy-in: plays that modeled all 3 NRR components (expansion, contraction, churn) received budget approval 40% faster.
- Account maps with only the champion (no economic buyer) collapsed in 60% of cases when the champion left the company.

## Recommendations
- Always set trigger threshold AND time window together (e.g., ">80% for 14 days" not ">80%").
- Build the NRR model first -- it frames the business case for the entire play.
- Map the economic buyer before building the talk track -- talk track must address their priorities, not the champion's.
- For ENT accounts, require QBR prep slide even if QBR is months away -- it enforces customer-metric framing.
- Auto-alert at 80% utilization, but schedule expansion conversation for 85%+ -- gives CSM 5% runway to prepare.
