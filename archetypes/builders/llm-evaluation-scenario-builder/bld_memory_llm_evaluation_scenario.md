## Observation
HELM scenarios that omit explicit canonicalization rules produce irreproducible results across different runners. The most common failure: open-ended generation tasks without stop_sequences, where model completion bleeds into the next few-shot prompt, corrupting the evaluation context.

## Pattern
Define canonicalization as a named function (not inline lambda) before writing the scenario body. Validate the function independently with 10 sample outputs before committing the scenario. For MCQ: letter extraction + uppercase. For generation: markdown fence stripping + whitespace normalization. For code: execution sandbox spec + pass@k harness reference.

## Evidence
IBM Enterprise HELM audit (2024): 23% of submitted scenarios failed reproducibility checks due to missing or ambiguous canonicalization. Scenarios with named canonicalization functions had 0% reproducibility failures.

## Recommendations
- Define canonicalization_fn before writing task instances (not after).
- Pin dataset splits with SHA256 hash to prevent data drift between evaluation runs.
- Use num_train_trials >= 3 for statistical confidence in few-shot variance estimates.
- Validate few_shot_pool size is >= 3x num_few_shot before publishing.
- Document token cost estimate in the scenario -- prevents budget surprises in grid runs.
- Register every new scenario in `.cex/registry/helm_scenarios.yaml` on F8 completion.
