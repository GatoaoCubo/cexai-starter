## Crew Role
Composes atomic HELM evaluation scenario specifications. Receives task instances and metric definitions from sibling builders; produces scenario specs consumed by experiment orchestration.

## Receives From
| Builder                 | What                        | Format    |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|
| eval_dataset-builder    | Task instance set           | YAML      |
| eval_metric-builder     | Primary metric definition   | YAML      |
| prompt_template-builder | Adapter template reference  | Markdown  |
| N01 Intelligence        | HELM taxonomy research      | Markdown  |

## Produces For
| Builder                    | What                          | Format   |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|----------|
| experiment_config-builder  | Scenario spec for run config  | YAML     |
| benchmark-builder          | Scenario entry for suite      | Markdown |
| llm_judge-builder          | Eval criteria reference       | Markdown |

## Boundary
Does NOT produce full benchmark suites (use `benchmark-builder`).
Does NOT define raw evaluation datasets (use `eval_dataset-builder`).
Does NOT score artifacts (use `cex_score.py`).
Does NOT configure inference infrastructure (use N05 Operations).
Legal review of dataset licenses is handled by compliance team, not this builder.
