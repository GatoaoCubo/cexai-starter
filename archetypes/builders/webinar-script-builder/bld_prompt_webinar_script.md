## Phase 1: RESEARCH
Gather all inputs before writing a single line of script. Incomplete research produces misaligned hooks and off-target CTAs.
| Research Item | Questions to Answer | Source |
|--------------|--------------------|----|
| Audience profile | Job title, pain points, desired outcome from attending | Brief, persona docs |
| Webinar goal | Education, product demo, lead generation, or upsell | Marketing brief |
| Duration | 45 min, 60 min, or 90 min -- determines segment budget | Event logistics |
| Panelists | Names, titles, talking point ownership per segment | Speaker list |
| Demo assets | Product screens, live environment URL, fallback video | Product team |
| Registration data | Expected attendee count, registration page URL | Event platform |
| Competing webinars | What else is live this week in same topic area | Calendar check |
**Time budget calculation**: Total duration minus 4 min (hook + agenda) minus 10 min (Q&A) minus 2 min (CTA close) = available segment minutes. Divide evenly across segments (max 3).

## Phase 2: COMPOSE

Write sections in this exact order. Skipping ahead produces structural gaps.

### Step 1: Hook / Opening (60 sec / ~150 words)
- State attendee benefit in sentence 1: "By the end of this session, you will [specific outcome]."
- Apply one hook framework: 3-2-1 countdown, bold claim, or pain-agitate-solution.
- Include [SLIDE 1: Title Slide] cue.
- Add [SPEAKER NOTE: energy level, eye contact cue].

### Step 2: Agenda Preview (2 min)
- List exactly what will be covered -- 3 items maximum.
- State what will NOT be covered to set expectations.
- Include [SLIDE 2: Agenda] cue.
- Mention Q&A timing: "We will take questions at the end."

### Step 3: Value Segments (1 to 3 segments, time-budgeted)
- Each segment: heading with timestamp [XX:00] + duration in minutes.
- Each segment: one [SLIDE X: title] cue per transition.
- Each segment: speaker note with key stat or story to reinforce point.
- Use the structure: Problem -> Evidence -> Solution -> Example.

### Step 4: Demo Walk-through (if applicable)
- Open with: "Let me show you exactly how this works."
- Break demo into numbered steps with [SLIDE X] or [SCREEN: action] cues.
- Include a fallback note: "[SPEAKER NOTE: If live demo fails, switch to recording at URL]."
- Close demo with: "What you just saw was [outcome summary]."

### Step 5: Q&A Facilitation (10 min)
- Write moderator intro script: "We are opening the Q&A. [Name] will be watching the chat."
- Write 3 seed questions that prime the audience if no questions arrive in the first 60 seconds.
- Write a graceful close if time runs out: "We have time for one more question."

### Step 6: CTA Close (2 min)
- State the single CTA clearly: trial, download, consultation, or next webinar registration.
- Include registration URL or short link.
- Include [SLIDE X: CTA slide] cue.
- Close with: "Thank you for joining [Webinar Title]. See you next time."

### Step 7: Speaker Notes Review
- Verify every segment has at least one [SPEAKER NOTE].
- Verify all [SLIDE X] cues are sequential and match the deck outline.
- Verify word count fits time budget (150 words per minute).

## Phase 3: VALIDATE

Run the following checklist before delivering the script. All HARD gates must pass.

| Gate | Check | Pass Condition |
|------|-------|---------------|
| H01 | YAML frontmatter valid | All required fields present |
| H02 | ID pattern | Matches ^p03_ws_ |
| H03 | Kind | webinar_script |
| H04 | Hook present | In first section, under 60 sec |
| H05 | Agenda preview | Dedicated section present |
| H06 | Value segment | At least one segment with content |
| H07 | Q&A seed questions | Minimum 3 seed questions written |
| H08 | CTA | Explicit CTA with URL in closing section |
| TC | Time budget | Word count / 150 <= duration_minutes |
| SC | Slide cues | Every segment transition has [SLIDE X] cue |
| SN | Speaker notes | Every segment has at least one [SPEAKER NOTE] |

If any HARD gate fails, return to Phase 2 and correct before delivery.
