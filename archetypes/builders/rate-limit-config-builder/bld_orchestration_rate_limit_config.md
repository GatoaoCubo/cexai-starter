# Collaboration: rate-limit-config-builder

This ISO encodes a rate limit policy -- throttle bounds, quota windows, and backoff behavior.
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "what are the RPM, TPM, budget, and tier limits for this provider and tier?"
I do not define retry logic. I do not define API credentials. I do not define execution timeouts.
I declare the numeric quota boundaries so callers know exactly what they can consume.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Provider Integration"
```
  1. rate-limit-config-builder -> "quota declaration (RPM, TPM, budget, tier)"
  2. runtime-rule-builder       -> "retry/backoff policy for 429 handling"
  3. env-config-builder         -> "API key, base URL, model selection"
```
### Crew: "Multi-Provider Setup"
```
  1. rate-limit-config-builder (anthropic) -> "Anthropic Build tier limits"
  2. rate-limit-config-builder (openai)    -> "OpenAI Tier 2 limits"
  3. rate-limit-config-builder (litellm)   -> "LiteLLM proxy unified limits"
  4. client-builder                        -> "client that reads all three configs"
```
### Crew: "Cost-Controlled Production"
```
  1. rate-limit-config-builder -> "quota + budget_usd + alert_threshold"
  2. guardrail-builder         -> "execution constraints, circuit breaker policy"
  3. monitor-builder           -> "observability for 429 rate and budget burn"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: provider name, tier, monthly budget target
- optional: model list (for model_overrides), concurrent target, retry_after preference
### I Produce
- rate_limit_config artifact (.md with YAML frontmatter)
- committed to: `cex/P09_config/examples/p09_ratelimit_{provider}.md`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with specific gate failures listed
## Builders I Depend On
None — independent builder (layer 0). Rate limit configs can be defined standalone
once provider and tier are known.
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| runtime-rule-builder | Needs retry_after and quota values to size backoff windows |
| client-builder | Reads RPM/TPM to implement throttling and request queuing |
| guardrail-builder | References budget_usd and alert_threshold for cost circuit breakers |
| monitor-builder | Uses RPM/TPM as baselines for 429-rate alerting thresholds |
| agent-builder | Agents enforce rate limits during parallel task execution |
