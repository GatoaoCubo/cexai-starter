## Summary
Hook lifecycle configuration — declares which hooks fire at each build phase. The difference between a useful hook_config and a useless one is clean declaration
with conditions versus embedded implementation code.
## Pattern
**Declaration with conditions.**
Every hook must have: phase, event, action, and condition.
Required body sections: Overview, Hooks, Lifecycle, Integration.
Body budget: 4096 bytes max.
## Anti-Pattern
1. Embedding implementation: hook_config declares WHAT fires; hook implements HOW it runs
2. Missing conditions: Hooks without conditions fire unconditionally, causing noise
3. Phase mismatch: Declaring post-build hooks in pre-build phase breaks execution order
4. Overlapping events: Multiple hooks on same event without priority causes race conditions
## Context
The 4096-byte body limit keeps hook_config artifacts focused. Fill required fields first,
then add recommended fields if space permits. Always set quality: null.
