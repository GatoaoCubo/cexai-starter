## Observation
Developers often omit the specific quantization algorithm, leading to unexpected fallback to unquantized weights. Mismatched bit-widths and data types frequently cause runtime errors during model loading on specific hardware.

## Pattern
Providing a clear mapping between the quantization method and its required hyperparameters ensures stability. Explicitly setting the compute data type helps maintain accuracy during the dequantization process.

## Evidence
Reviewed 4-bit NF4 and 8-bit integer quantization configuration artifacts.

## Recommendations
* Always specify the quantization_method (e.g., "bitsandbytes", "awq").
* Match bits and group_size to the target inference engine's capabilities.
* Define compute_dtype (e.g., "float16") to prevent precision degradation.
* Keep this config strictly limited to weight precision settings.
* Ensure scale and zero_point parameters are compatible with the chosen bit-width.
