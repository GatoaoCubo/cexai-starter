# Collaboration: naming-rule-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "what naming convention governs this artifact domain?"
I define scope-bound patterns (prefix, suffix, separator, case, versioning, collision resolution). I do NOT validate whether existing names comply — that goes to validator-builder.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "New Artifact Domain Bootstrap"
```
  1. type-def-builder          -> "defines what the artifact IS abstractly"
  2. naming-rule-builder       -> "defines how the artifact must be named"
  3. validation-schema-builder -> "encodes naming rule as machine-checkable schema"
```
### Crew: "Convention + Enforcement"
```
  1. naming-rule-builder  -> "produces p05_nr_{scope}.md with naming pattern"
  2. validator-builder    -> "checks existing artifacts against the naming rule"
  3. formatter-builder    -> "formats output so names appear in canonical form"
```
### Crew: "Code Generator Pipeline"
```
  1. naming-rule-builder  -> "specifies variable and file naming conventions"
  2. instruction-builder  -> "embeds naming rules into agent execution steps"
  3. parser-builder       -> "extracts named fields from generated output"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: scope name, artifact domain, target platform (files/variables/agents/tables)
- optional: existing naming examples, collision frequency, versioning needs
### I Produce
- naming_rule artifact (Markdown, max 4KB)
- committed to: `cex/P05/examples/p05_nr_{scope}.md`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons
## Builders I Depend On
- type-def-builder: clarifies what entity is being named before conventions are set
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| validator-builder | needs the naming rule to check compliance |
| formatter-builder | uses naming conventions to canonicalize output |
| instruction-builder | embeds naming rules into procedural steps |
| validation-schema-builder | encodes naming pattern as enforceable schema |
