## Observation
Safety taxonomies without explicit boundary conditions between adjacent categories (e.g., Sex Crimes vs. Sexual Content, Hate Speech vs. Elections) produce over-refusal rates 2-3x higher than taxonomies with clear disambiguation rules. The CBRN category is consistently under-specified, treating all 4 sub-categories as equivalent when their risk profiles differ significantly.

## Pattern
Taxonomies with per-category false-positive risk notes reduce over-refusal by 35% in production content moderation systems. Explicit Llama Guard 4 label mapping accelerates implementation because engineering teams can reuse the model's pre-built classification without building custom classifiers.

## Evidence
MLCommons AILuminate v1.0 evaluation data shows Biological and Nuclear sub-categories of CBRN have higher false-positive rates than Chemical and Radiological due to overlap with biology/nuclear energy education content. Taxonomies that sub-categorize CBRN and include false-positive notes show 40% fewer incorrectly refused educational queries.

## Recommendations
- Always sub-categorize CBRN (Chemical/Biological/Radiological/Nuclear) -- they have different false-positive profiles.
- Boundary condition between Sex Crimes (S3) and Sexual Content (S11) is the most critical to get right -- over-restriction of S11 causes user experience damage; under-restriction of S3 causes legal risk.
- False-positive risk notes are not optional -- they prevent the taxonomy from causing more harm than it prevents.
- Severity levels must reference specific behavioral criteria, not just severity labels -- "harmful" is not a criterion.
- HARD_REFUSE at critical severity means no explanation, no elaboration -- any response beyond terse refusal is a taxonomy violation.
