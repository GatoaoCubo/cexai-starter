## Architectural Position

procedural_memory is a P10 (Memory) kind. In the P10 cluster hierarchy:
- memory_architecture defines what layers exist and which tier is active
- consolidation_policy defines lifecycle rules (TTL, eviction, promotion)
- procedural_memory defines the skill library living within the procedural layer

An agent system may have multiple procedural_memory artifacts (one per skill domain),
all governed by a single consolidation_policy and under one memory_architecture.
