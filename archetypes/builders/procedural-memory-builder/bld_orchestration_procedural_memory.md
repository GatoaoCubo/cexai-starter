## Crew Role
Defines the skill storage layer within a complete agent memory system. Consumes
memory_architecture (tier, procedural backend) and consolidation_policy (skill TTL,
versioning rules) to produce procedural_memory artifacts that specify the skill library
structure. Other builders reference procedural_memory for skill availability at runtime.

## Receives From
| Builder | What | Format |
|---------|------|--------|
| memory-architecture-builder | Tier, procedural layer backend config | memory_architecture artifact |
| consolidation-policy-builder | Skill TTL, versioning policy, eviction rules | consolidation_policy artifact |
| knowledge-card-builder | Domain research on Voyager/Reflexion/ExpeL | knowledge_card artifact |

## Produces For
| Builder | What | Format |
|---------|------|--------|
| agent-builder | Skill availability per tier for system prompt | Skill list + tier summary |
| knowledge-card-builder | Lessons from skill library patterns | Feedback on domain |
| N06 commercial review | Enterprise skill ACL + versioning config | Tier matrix |

## Boundary
Does NOT produce:
- Memory layer definitions or backend specs (-> memory_architecture kind)
- Memory lifecycle rules or eviction policies (-> consolidation_policy kind)
- Fact/entity storage (-> entity_memory or knowledge_index kinds)
- Semantic memory (-> knowledge_card or knowledge_graph kinds)
- Agent routing or tool call configs (-> agent kind, P02)

## Dispatch Pattern
In a grid dispatch building a complete agent memory system:
1. N06 (commercial) builds `memory_architecture` first (tier, layer definitions)
2. N06 (commercial) builds `consolidation_policy` (lifecycle rules)
3. N04 (knowledge) builds `procedural_memory` for each skill domain
4. N01 (intelligence) or N06 validates tier matrices are consistent across all three
5. N07 consolidates: all artifacts form the complete P10 memory cluster spec
