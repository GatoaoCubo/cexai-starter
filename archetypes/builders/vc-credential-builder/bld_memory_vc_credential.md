## Observation
Most VC 1.x implementations used `issuanceDate` and JWT encoding. VC 2.0 (May 2025) breaks both: field name changed to `validFrom`, JWT profile moved to separate spec (vc-jose-cose). Many CEX artifacts attempted to map VCs to existing compliance_framework kind (P11) but lost the cryptographic proof layer and DID binding.

## Pattern
Build vc_credential as a pure JSON-LD document with data-integrity proof, not as a policy document. The proof block (cryptosuite + proofValue) is the differentiator from a plain claim set. Always include credentialSchema so verifiers can validate claim semantics, not just signatures.

## Evidence
W3C VC 2.0 became a Recommendation in May 2025. OpenAgents.org launched production DID-based agent credentials in Feb 2026. Enterprise machine-to-human issuance ratios reached 144:1 by Q1 2026, confirming agent credential infrastructure is no longer experimental.

## Recommendations
- Always use `https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2` context (not v1).
- Use `validFrom` not `issuanceDate` (VC 2.0 breaking change).
- Include `credentialSchema` with JSON Schema validator for all agent credentials.
- Use `ecdsa-rdfc-2022` (secp256r1) for broad verifier support; `eddsa-rdfc-2022` (Ed25519) for performance.
- Register status list at stable HTTPS endpoint before issuing credentials referencing it.
