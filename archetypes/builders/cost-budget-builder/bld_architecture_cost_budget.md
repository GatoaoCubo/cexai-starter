## Component Inventory
| Name | Role | Owner | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| scope | System boundary this budget covers: global, provider, or model | cost-budget-builder | required |
| budget_catalog | Per-provider/model entries: limits, threshold, reset, action | cost-budget-builder | required |
| alert_policy | Threshold tiers (warn/block), channels, escalation path | cost-budget-builder | required |
| overage_rules | Breach behavior, grace period, limit increase process | cost-budget-builder | required |
| reset_policy | When spend counters reset (daily/weekly/monthly/rolling/none) | cost-budget-builder | required |
| currency | Budget unit: USD or token_units | cost-budget-builder | required |
| enforcement_ref | Reference to runtime enforcer (cex_token_budget.py) | cost-budget-builder | recommended |
| metadata | id, version, pillar, scope, author, created date | cost-budget-builder | required |

## Dependency Graph
```
guardrail (P11) --constrains--> cost_budget (security: no credentials in artifact)
rate_limit_config (P09) --orthogonal-- cost_budget (RPM/TPM throughput vs USD/token spend)
cost_budget --enforced_by--> cex_token_budget.py (runtime SDK reads budget at call time)
cost_budget --alerts_via--> trace_config (P09) (alert channels reference trace/logging config)
cost_budget --consumed_by--> boot_config (P02) (boot may check budget before starting provider)
cost_budget --consumed_by--> agent (P02) (agent respects budget for its LLM calls)
cost_budget --consumed_by--> workflow (P12) (workflow gates steps on budget availability)
env_config (P09) --independent-- cost_budget (env_config = variable catalog; cost_budget = spend limit)
feature_flag (P09) --independent-- cost_budget (feature_flag = on/off toggle; cost_budget = spend cap)
```

| From | To | Type | Data |
|------|----|------|------|
| guardrail | cost_budget | constrains | no credentials, no payment data in artifact |
| cost_budget | cex_token_budget.py | enforced_by | limits, thresholds, reset policy read at call time |
| cost_budget | trace_config | alerts_via | alert channels, webhook URLs |
| cost_budget | boot_config | consumed_by | provider budget checked before startup |
| cost_budget | agent | consumed_by | per-call budget check before LLM invocation |
| cost_budget | workflow | consumed_by | step gate: sufficient budget to proceed? |

## Boundary Table
| cost_budget IS | cost_budget IS NOT |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Spend governance: USD or token limits per provider/model | rate_limit_config (P09) -- rate limits govern RPM/TPM throughput, not total spend |
| Alert thresholds: warn and block at configured percentages | env_config (P09) -- env_config catalogs environment variables, not spend limits |
| Reset policy: when spend counters start fresh | feature_flag (P09) -- feature_flag is an on/off toggle, not a spend specification |
| Overage rules: what happens when limit is hit | permission (P09) -- permission governs access control, not cost limits |
| Scope hierarchy: global > provider > model | runtime_rule (P09) -- runtime_rule governs timeouts/retries, not spending |
| Enforcement reference: points to runtime SDK | billing_account (external) -- actual billing is external; artifact is policy only |

## Layer Map
| Layer | Components | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Safety | guardrail, alert_policy | Prevent overspend, enforce notification chain |
| Governance | budget_catalog, reset_policy, overage_rules | Define limits and consequences |
| Enforcement | cex_token_budget.py reference | Runtime check at every LLM call |
| Observability | trace_config integration | Spend metrics, alert delivery, audit trail |
