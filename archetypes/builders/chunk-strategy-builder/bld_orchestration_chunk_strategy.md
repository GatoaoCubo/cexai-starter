# Collaboration: chunk-strategy-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "what are the parameters and constraints for this chunk strategy?"
I specify chunk strategy configurations so agents and pipelines can use them.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "RAG Pipeline"
```
  1. chunk-strategy-builder -> chunking config
  2. embedding-config-builder -> vector model config
  3. retriever-config-builder -> search config
```
### Crew: "Document Processing"
```
  1. chunk-strategy-builder -> split strategy
  2. document-loader-builder -> ingestion
  3. parser-builder -> extraction
```

## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
1. seeds: chunk strategy purpose, target system, constraints
2. optional: specific parameter values, upstream artifact references
### I Produce
1. chunk_strategy artifact (.md + .yaml frontmatter)
2. committed to: `cex/P01_knowledge/examples/p01_chunk_{name}.md`
### I Signal
1. signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
2. if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons
## Builders I Depend On
None — independent builder (layer 0).
