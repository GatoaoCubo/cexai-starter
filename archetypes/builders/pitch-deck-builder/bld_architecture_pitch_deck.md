## Architectural Position
pitch_deck is a P05 output builder producing investor-facing slide narratives. It occupies the conversion-narrative layer alongside interactive_demo (self-serve evaluation) and product_tour (in-app activation). The narrative arc -- problem -> solution -> proof -> ask -- runs as a through-line across all three kinds.
