## Examples

## Golden Example (pitch deck)
**Title**: Streamline HR with AI
**Subtitle**: Automating payroll and benefits for SMEs
**Author**: A. Smith, CEO | Example Corp
**Date**: March 2024

### Problem
Small businesses waste 20+ hours/month on manual payroll, leading to errors and compliance risks.

### Solution
The platform automates payroll, tax filings, and benefits using AI, integrating with accounting software and team chat tools.

### Traction
- 10,000+ businesses active users
- 50% YoY growth since 2022
- 4.8/5 NPS score

### Ask
$5M Series A to expand to Europe and build AI-driven benefits planning.

## Anti-Example 1: Missing Problem/Solution Structure
**Title**: Example Corp -- The Future of HR
**Body**:
- "We offer a platform for payroll and benefits."
- "Our users love our UI."
- "We’ve grown 50% YoY."

## Why it fails
No clear problem or solution. Focuses on features over value, making it hard to evaluate the business’s purpose.

## Anti-Example 2: Vague Traction Metrics
**Title**: Example Corp -- Automating HR
**Body**:
- "Problem: Manual payroll is tedious."
- "Solution: AI-driven automation."
- "Traction: We’re growing fast."
- "Ask: $5M for expansion."

## Why it fails
Traction lacks quantifiable data (e.g., user numbers, growth rates). Investors can’t assess momentum or validate claims.

### H_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (HARD)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (min 3 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream or sibling reference
- Gate: REJECT if < 3 entries (auto-populated by cex_wikilink.py at F6.5)

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
