## Observation
Common issues include inconsistent data formatting between components and unclear metric aggregation logic, leading to fragmented evaluation pipelines. Overlooking versioning of evaluation metrics often causes compatibility drift across framework updates.

## Pattern
Modular design with decoupled data loaders and metric calculators enables flexible integration. Centralized configuration management ensures consistent parameter handling across evaluation stages.

## Evidence
Reviewed artifacts showed frameworks using JSON-schema aligned data interfaces reduced integration errors by 40% compared to ad-hoc formats.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize modularity by separating data processing, metric calculation, and result aggregation into distinct modules.
- Adopt standardized data formats (e.g., JSON, Parquet) for input/output across all framework components.
- Implement versioned metric definitions with semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.2.0`) to track compatibility.
- Use configuration files (e.g., YAML) to centralize hyperparameters and evaluation settings.
- Include automated validation checks for data integrity and metric consistency during framework assembly.
