## Observation  
Inconsistent module boundary definitions often lead to fragmented or overlapping repo_map entries. Over-reliance on file structure alone may miss implicit dependencies or cross-cutting concerns.  

## Pattern  
Combining static analysis with manual curation improves accuracy. Focusing on explicit markers (e.g., `@context` annotations) and architectural decisions aligns maps with developer intent.  

## Evidence  
Artifacts from `repo_map-builder-v2` showed 25% fewer inconsistencies after integrating semantic markers with file-based heuristics.  

## Recommendations  
- Define explicit criteria for module boundaries (e.g., package structure + semantic roles).  
- Prioritize tooling that surfaces implicit dependencies (e.g., call graphs, import analysis).  
- Validate maps iteratively with domain experts to align with operational workflows.  
- Avoid over-segmentation; balance granularity with maintainability.  
- Document exclusion rules to prevent accidental omission of critical context.
