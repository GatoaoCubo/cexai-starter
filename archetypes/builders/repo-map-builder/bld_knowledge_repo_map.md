## Domain Overview
Repo_map is the codebase context strategy pioneered by Aider (github.com/paul-gauthier/aider).
The core problem: LLM context windows are finite; codebases are large. The solution: rank
ALL files by relevance and fit the top-ranked symbols into the token budget.

The Aider repo map uses tree-sitter to extract symbols (classes, functions, variables) from
every source file, then applies a graph-ranking algorithm (similar to PageRank) to determine
which files/symbols are most relevant to the current conversation. Only the highest-ranked
symbols are included, respecting the token budget.

Key insight: a repo map is NOT a file tree listing. It is a **ranked symbol table** where
importance is determined by graph centrality, not alphabetical order.

## Core Technical Concepts
| Concept | Definition | Implementation |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| tree-sitter | Incremental parser library producing concrete syntax trees | `tree_sitter.Language`, `tree_sitter_languages` pip package |
| Symbol extraction | Parsing source files to extract named code entities | tree-sitter queries: `(function_definition name: (identifier) @name)` |
| AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) | Tree representation of source code structure | tree-sitter produces CST; simplified to AST via queries |
| PageRank (graph ranking) | Iterative link-analysis to rank nodes by centrality | `networkx.pagerank(G, alpha=0.85)` on symbol reference graph |
| Token budget | Max tokens allocatable to repo map context | Controlled by `--map-tokens` in Aider (default: 1024) |
| File selection heuristics | Rules for prioritizing files to include | Mentioned files get 2x weight; recently changed get 1.5x boost |

## tree-sitter Symbol Extraction
tree-sitter parses source files into typed syntax trees using language grammars.
Queries extract named symbols:

```python
# Python: extract all function/class definitions
query = lang.query("""
    (function_definition name: (identifier) @name) @def
    (class_definition name: (identifier) @name) @def
""")
matches = query.matches(tree.root_node)
```

Supported in Aider repo map: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, C/C++, Ruby,
PHP, C#, Swift, Kotlin, Scala -- 40+ languages via tree-sitter-languages.

Fallback: Universal ctags (`ctags --output-format=json -R .`) for languages without tree-sitter grammar.

## Graph Ranking (PageRank)
Build a directed reference graph where nodes = files, edges = symbol references:

```python
import networkx as nx

G = nx.DiGraph()
for file, symbols in repo_symbols.items():
    for ref in symbols['references']:
        target = resolve_symbol(ref, repo_symbols)
        if target:
            G.add_edge(file, target['file'])
```

Files mentioned in the chat get personalization boost. High in-degree = many files reference
this file = high importance. The top-N files by score are included until token budget exhausted.

## Token Budget Management
| Parameter | Default | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| --map-tokens | 1024 | Total token budget for repo map |
| --map-multiplier-no-files | 2 | Budget multiplier when no files in context |
| symbol truncation | 100 chars/symbol | Truncate long signatures to save tokens |
| file cap | 20 files max | Never include more than 20 files even if budget allows |

Token counting: `tiktoken` (OpenAI) or `anthropic.count_tokens()` for Claude models.

```python
import tiktoken
enc = tiktoken.get_encoding("cl100k_base")
tokens = len(enc.encode(repo_map_text))
```

## File Selection Heuristics
Aider's file selection priority order:
1. **Files explicitly mentioned** in current conversation (highest priority, 2x boost)
2. **Files in current diff/git status** (recently changed, 1.5x boost)
3. **High PageRank score** (frequently referenced by other files)
4. **Test files paired with source** (test_foo.py <-> foo.py linked)
5. **Entry points** (main.py, index.ts, app.go -- named by convention)
6. **Files with recent git commits** (active development areas)

Exclusion rules:
- Binary files (images, compiled artifacts)
- Lock files (package-lock.json, poetry.lock)
- Generated files (.pb.go, _generated.ts)
- Files larger than 100KB (too large for symbol extraction)

## Common Patterns
1. Parse all files with tree-sitter, cache results keyed on (path, mtime)
2. Build reference graph from import statements + call sites
3. Apply PageRank with personalization for mentioned files
4. Sort files by score, add to map until token budget reached
5. Output as structured text: `path/to/file.py:\n  class Foo:\n  def bar(self):`
6. Regenerate map on every conversation turn (fast with incremental update)
