## Component Inventory
| Name | Role | Owner | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| provider | Secret backend that stores and serves credentials | secret_config | required |
| rotation_policy | Rules governing how and when secrets are replaced | secret_config | required |
| encryption | At-rest and in-transit protection posture | secret_config | required |
| access_pattern | Method by which agents retrieve secrets at runtime | secret_config | required |
| secret_paths | Provider-specific references (paths, ARNs, key names) | secret_config | required |
| lease_duration | TTL for dynamic secrets or tokens | secret_config | conditional |
| audit_log | Record of all secret access events | secret_config | required |
| env_config | Generic non-sensitive environment variables | P09 | sibling |
| permission | Access control rules (who can use what) | P09 | sibling |
| agent | Runtime consumer that retrieves secrets for operations | P02 | consumer |
| guardrail | Execution constraints on secret operations | P11 | external |
## Dependency Graph
```
provider        --produces--> secret_paths
rotation_policy --governs-->  secret_paths
encryption      --protects--> secret_paths
access_pattern  --describes-> secret_paths
lease_duration  --constrains-> access_pattern (dynamic only)
audit_log       --monitors--> access_pattern
agent           --consumes--> access_pattern
guardrail       --constrains-> agent
permission      --gates-->    agent
```
| From | To | Type | Data |
|------|----|------|------|
| provider | secret_paths | produces | storage location references |
| rotation_policy | secret_paths | governs | replacement schedule and method |
| encryption | secret_paths | protects | at-rest and in-transit cipher |
| access_pattern | secret_paths | describes | retrieval method at runtime |
| lease_duration | access_pattern | constrains | TTL for dynamic leases |
| audit_log | access_pattern | monitors | access event recording |
| agent | access_pattern | consumes | secret retrieval at task time |
| guardrail | agent | constrains | timeout and scope limits |
| permission | agent | gates | identity-based access approval |
## Boundary Table
| secret_config IS | secret_config IS NOT |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Credential and secret management specification | Generic env var config — that is env_config |
| Defines provider, rotation, encryption, access | Access control rules — that is permission |
| Governs sensitive values requiring rotation | On/off feature toggles — that is feature_flag |
| Specifies how agents retrieve secrets at runtime | Throttling or rate rules — that is rate_limit_config |
| Provider-specific (Vault, K8s, AWS, Portkey...) | Boot or startup parameters — that is boot_config |
## Layer Map
| Layer | Components | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| storage | provider, secret_paths | Where credentials live and how they are addressed |
| protection | encryption, audit_log | How credentials are secured and access is tracked |
| lifecycle | rotation_policy, lease_duration | How credentials change over time |
| retrieval | access_pattern | How agents get credentials at runtime |
| governance | guardrail, permission | Who can access and under what constraints |
| consumers | agent | Runtime processes that use the credentials |
