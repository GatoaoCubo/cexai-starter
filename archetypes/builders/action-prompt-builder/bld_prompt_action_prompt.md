# Instructions: How to Produce an action_prompt
## Phase 1: RESEARCH
1. Identify the action: what task needs a prompt, expressed as a verb phrase
2. Define input contract: what data types and formats are provided to the prompt
3. Define output contract: what the result should look like (structure, format, constraints)
4. Analyze existing action_prompts via brain_query [IF MCP] to avoid duplicates
5. Enumerate edge cases: at least 2 scenarios where input is ambiguous or malformed
6. Determine constraints: what the prompt must NOT do (no identity, no multi-step recipes)
7. Identify purpose: WHY this action prompt exists (business value, not just mechanics)
## Phase 2: COMPOSE
1. Read SCHEMA.md — source of truth for all fields
2. Read OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md — fill template following SCHEMA constraints
3. Fill frontmatter: all 21 fields (null OK for optional)
4. Set quality: null (NEVER self-score)
5. Write Context section: 2-3 sentences on background and purpose of the action
6. Write Input section: specific data items with types, required/optional, and defaults
7. Write Execution section: concise steps to transform input into output (no sub-steps)
8. Write Output section: expected structure, format, and one inline example
9. Write Validation section: criteria to verify output correctness and completeness
10. Check body <= 3072 bytes
## Phase 3: VALIDATE
1. Check QUALITY_GATES.md manually (no automated validator yet)
2. HARD gates: YAML parses, id matches `p03_ap_` pattern, kind == action_prompt, quality == null, required fields present, body has all 5 sections, edge_cases >= 2
3. SOFT gates: check each against QUALITY_GATES.md
4. Cross-check: action is verb phrase? Input has types? No identity/persona leaking? No detailed multi-step recipe (that would be instruction)?
5. If score < 8.0: revise in same pass before outputting
