# Collaboration: action-prompt-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "what prompt should be injected to make the agent execute this specific task?"
I do not define agent identity. I do not write step-by-step recipes.
I produce task-focused prompts so agents can execute specific operations with defined input/output.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Agent Prompt Stack"
```
  1. context-doc-builder -> "domain context for hydration"
  2. instruction-builder -> "step-by-step execution recipe"
  3. action-prompt-builder -> "task-focused prompt with I/O contract"
  4. few-shot-example-builder -> "format examples for the prompt"
```
### Crew: "Task Execution Setup"
```
  1. input-schema-builder -> "input contract definition"
  2. action-prompt-builder -> "execution prompt with defined I/O"
  3. golden-test-builder -> "reference output for quality calibration"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: task description, expected input format, expected output format
- optional: domain context, edge cases, validation criteria
### I Produce
- action_prompt artifact (.md + .yaml frontmatter)
- committed to: `cex/P03/examples/p03_ap_{scope}.md`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons
## Builders I Depend On
- context-doc-builder: provides domain context for prompt hydration
- input-schema-builder: provides input contract that the prompt must respect
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| chain-builder | Chains compose multiple action_prompts in sequence |
| golden-test-builder | Needs prompt output to create reference examples |
| e2e-eval-builder | Tests full pipeline that includes action_prompts |
