## Summary
An action prompt is a contract between a caller and an execution engine. The 21 frontmatter fields exist to make that contract explicit and machine-verifiable. In forctice, the contract breaks at the edges: inputs near boundary values and output fields with ambiguous format expectations.
High-quality action prompts treat edge cases as first-class requirements, not afterthoughts. They also include at least one fully-worked example that demonstrates the complete input-to-output transformation.
## Pattern
**Complete contract construction:**
1. List all input fields with types, constraints, and defaults.
2. For each input field, write at least one edge case: empty string, null, max-length value, invalid type.
3. Write the output schema with concrete example values (not just type names).
4. Specify what the prompt does when an edge case is encountered (reject, default, transform).
5. Fill all 21 frontmatter fields. Fields left as placeholders cause downstream parsing failures.
The 21 frontmatter fields are not decorative. Downstream routing systems read specific fields (`domain`, `version`, `input_schema`) to decide how to invoke the prompt. Incomplete frontmatter silently routes to fallback behavior.
## Anti-Pattern
Writing the prompt body first and then retrofitting the frontmatter produces incomplete contracts. The body naturally handles the happy path, and the frontmatter then mirrors only what the body already covers, leaving edge cases undocumented.
Also avoid vague output format descriptions like "a JSON object with relevant fields." Name every field. Vague format descriptions produce variable outputs that pass manual review but fail automated parsing.
## Context
Action prompts are highest-value when they encode a decision that recurs frequently with similar inputs. One-off decisions do not benefit from the overhead of full contract specification. Reserve action prompt investment for decisions made 10+ times per week.
The 21-field frontmatter standard emerged from iterative failures in prompt versioning and routing. Each field maps to a documented failure mode that occurred without it.
## Impact
Prompts with complete contracts (all 21 fields + edge cases + concrete examples) required 1.1 revision cycles on average. Prompts missing any of the three components required 3.4 revision cycles. The total authoring time is higher upfront but lower in aggregate.
## Reproducibility
High for prompts in stable domains. Lower for prompts in exploratory domains where input schema evolves. For evolving domains, version prompts aggressively (v0.x until schema stabilizes).
