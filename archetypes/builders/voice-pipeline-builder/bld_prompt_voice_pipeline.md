## Phase 1: RESEARCH  
1. Define voice_pipeline requirements: latency, accuracy, language support  
2. Analyze existing voice agent architectures (e.g., ASR, TTS, NLU integration)  
3. Gather audio datasets for training and validation (noise, accents, environments)  
4. Evaluate speech recognition models (e.g., Whisper, Kaldi) for performance metrics  
5. Research real-time processing frameworks (e.g., WebRTC, TensorFlow Lite)  
6. Document security/privacy constraints (data encryption, compliance)  

## Phase 2: COMPOSE  
1. Set up dev environment with Python 3.10+, PyTorch 2.0, and SCHEMA.md  
2. Define pipeline stages in SCHEMA.md: input → ASR → NLU → response → TTS  
3. Implement audio preprocessing (normalization, noise reduction)  
4. Integrate ASR model with OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md's `transcript` field  
5. Develop NLU module for intent classification and slot filling  
6. Wire TTS engine (e.g., Tacotron 2) to generate synthetic speech  
7. Add error handling for ASR/NLU failures (fallback responses)  
8. Write unit tests for each pipeline stage using pytest  
9. Package artifact with Dockerfile and requirements.txt  

## Phase 3: VALIDATE  
[ ] Validate schema alignment with SCHEMA.md  
[ ] Confirm all 4 core stages present: STT, NLU, dialogue management, TTS  
[ ] Verify audio preprocessing stage is documented  
[ ] Confirm provider abstraction (no hardcoded vendor names at interface level)  
[ ] Verify fallback chain documented for each stage  
[ ] Confirm error recovery defined at each stage boundary  
[ ] Validate id matches pattern: p04_vp_[a-z0-9_]+  
[ ] Run H01-H08 quality gate checks before delivering
