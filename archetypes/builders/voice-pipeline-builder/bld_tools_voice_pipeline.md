# Tools -- voice-pipeline-builder
## Tool Registry
| Tool | Status | Tag | Purpose |
|------|--------|-----|---------|
| brain_query | CONDITIONAL | [MCP] | Discover existing voice pipelines and STT/TTS integration patterns |
| Read | ACTIVE | [FS] | Read SCHEMA.md, OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md, sibling examples |
| Glob | ACTIVE | [FS] | Find existing p04_vp_* files in the pool |
| Grep | ACTIVE | [FS] | Search for component patterns or provider abstraction approaches |
| Write | ACTIVE | [FS] | Produce the final voice_pipeline artifact |
| Edit | ACTIVE | [FS] | Patch frontmatter or body sections during VALIDATE phase |

## Tool Descriptions
### brain_query [MCP] -- CONDITIONAL
Available only when the Brain MCP server is running. Use to:
- Find existing `voice_pipeline` artifacts that overlap with the requested use case
- Retrieve component naming conventions used in the pool
- Identify fallback chain patterns already documented

```
brain_query("voice pipeline STT NLU TTS architecture")
brain_query("P04 kind:voice_pipeline domain:{{domain}}")
brain_query("speech recognition dialogue management provider abstraction")
```

Mark results as advisory -- validate component names against SCHEMA.md before adopting.

### Read [FS] -- ACTIVE
Read before composing:
- `SCHEMA.md` -- source of truth for all field definitions
- `OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md` -- exact frontmatter and body structure to follow
- `QUALITY_GATES.md` -- gate list to validate against
- Sibling p04_vp_* files for naming and style reference

### Glob [FS] -- ACTIVE
```
records/pool/**/p04_vp_*.md
archetypes/builders/voice-pipeline-builder/
```

Use to check for ID collisions before assigning a new `id`.

### Grep [FS] -- ACTIVE
```
grep pattern: "components"          -- verify component list presence
grep pattern: "fallback"            -- check fallback chain documentation
grep pattern: "kind: voice_pipeline"  -- inventory existing pipelines
```

### Write [FS] -- ACTIVE
Final delivery tool. Write the completed artifact to its target path under `records/pool/` or
the caller-specified output path.

### Edit [FS] -- ACTIVE
Use during VALIDATE phase to patch specific fields (quality score, updated date, component list)
without rewriting the full file.

## Data Sources
| Source | Content | When to use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| SCHEMA.md | Field definitions, ID pattern, constraints | Every production run |
| OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md | Exact frontmatter + body structure | Every production run |
| QUALITY_GATES.md | H01-H08 HARD gates | Every validation run |
| KNOWLEDGE.md | STT/NLU/TTS concepts, latency targets, compliance requirements | When designing pipeline stages |
| MEMORY.md | Common mistakes, anti-patterns | When stuck or producing a variant |
| pool p04_vp_* files | Reference examples | When uncertain about style |
