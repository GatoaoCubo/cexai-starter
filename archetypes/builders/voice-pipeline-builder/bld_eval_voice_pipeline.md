## Quality Gate
## Definition
A `voice_pipeline` artifact defines the end-to-end architecture for voice agent processing:
STT, NLU, dialogue management, TTS components, their data flows, and error recovery strategies.
It describes system-level architecture -- NOT provider-specific tuning or implementation code.

Scope: files with `kind: voice_pipeline`. Does NOT apply to stt_provider (single STT config),
tts_provider (single TTS config), or realtime_session (live session state).

## HARD Gates
Failure on any single gate means REJECT regardless of soft score.

| ID  | Predicate | How to test |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| H01 | Frontmatter parses as valid YAML | `yaml.safe_load(frontmatter)` raises no error |
| H02 | `id` matches namespace `p04_vp_*` | `id.startswith("p04_vp_")` is true |
| H03 | `id` equals filename stem | `Path(file).stem == id` |
| H04 | `kind` equals literal `voice_pipeline` | string equality check |
| H05 | `quality` is null at authoring time | `quality is None` |
| H06 | All required frontmatter fields present and non-empty | id, kind, pillar, title, version, created, updated, author, domain, tags, tldr all present |

## SOFT Scoring
Score each dimension 0 (absent or fails) to 1 (present and passes). Weights are 0.5 or 1.0.

| #  | Dimension | Weight |
|----|-----------|--------|
| 1  | `density_score` field present and >= 0.80 | 1.0 |
| 2  | All 4 core stages present: STT, NLU, dialogue management, TTS | 1.0 |
| 3  | Fallback and error recovery mechanisms documented | 1.0 |
| 4  | Multi-provider or provider-agnostic design declared | 1.0 |
| 5  | Latency budget or performance targets specified | 0.5 |
| 6  | Audio preprocessing stage documented | 0.5 |

**Formula**: `final_score = (sum of score_i * weight_i) / (sum of weight_i) * 10`
Weight total: 9.0. Score range: 0.0 to 10.0.

## Actions
| Tier | Threshold | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| GOLDEN | >= 9.5 | Publish to pool; add to curated pipeline library |
| PUBLISH | >= 8.0 | Publish to pool; mark production-ready |
| REVIEW | >= 7.0 | Return to author with scored dimension feedback; one revision cycle |
| REJECT | < 7.0 | Block from pool; full rewrite required |

## Bypass
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| condition | Pipeline is a proof-of-concept with documented lifespan under 30 days |
| approver | Domain lead must approve in writing |
| audit_log | Record in `records/pool/audits/bypasses.md` with date, approver, reason |
| expiry | 30 days from bypass grant; pipeline must be retired or brought to full compliance |

## Properties
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Kind | `quality_gate` |
| Pillar | P11 |
| Domain | voice_pipeline construction |
| Pipeline | 8F (F1-F8) |
| Scorer | cex_score.py |
| Compiler | cex_compile.py |

## Examples
## Golden Example: Contact Center Voice Pipeline
```yaml
---
kind: voice_pipeline
id: p04_vp_contact_center_en
pillar: P04
title: "Contact Center Voice Pipeline (English)"
version: "1.0.0"
created: 2026-04-13
updated: 2026-04-13
```

### Pipeline Stages
| Stage | Provider | Input | Output |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| Audio Preprocessing | RNNoise + WebRTC VAD | Raw PCM 16kHz | Cleaned PCM 16kHz |
| STT | Deepgram Nova-2 (WebSocket streaming) | Cleaned PCM | JSON transcript |
| NLU | Rasa Open Source 3.x | Transcript text | Intent + entities |
| Dialogue Management | LangChain + GPT-4o | Intent + session history | Response text |
| TTS | ElevenLabs Turbo v2.5 (streaming) | Response text | MP3/PCM audio stream |

### Why it passes
- All 5 stages present including audio preprocessing ✓
- Real provider names (Deepgram Nova-2, Rasa, ElevenLabs Turbo) ✓
- Provider abstraction: each stage uses interface, not hardcoded API ✓
- `quality: null` in frontmatter ✓

## Anti-Example 1: Placeholder Provider Names
```yaml
---
kind: voice_pipeline
id: p04_vp_basic
pillar: P04
title: "Basic Voice Pipeline"
quality: null
---
components:
```

### Why it fails
`providerA`, `providerB`, `providerX`, `providerY` are placeholders.
They provide zero production guidance. Engineers cannot instantiate this pipeline.
Must use real names: Deepgram Nova-2, AssemblyAI, OpenAI Whisper for STT;
ElevenLabs, Google Cloud TTS, Amazon Polly for TTS.

**Also fails**: Missing NLU, dialogue management, and audio preprocessing stages.

---

## Anti-Example 2: Missing Audio Preprocessing
```yaml
---
kind: voice_pipeline
id: p04_vp_no_preproc
pillar: P04
title: "Unprocessed Voice Pipeline"
quality: null
---
stages:
```

### Why it fails
No audio preprocessing stage. In noisy environments (call center background noise,
mobile ambient sound), WER increases by 25-60% without preprocessing.
RNNoise or WebRTC VAD MUST precede STT. Also missing dialogue management stage.

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
