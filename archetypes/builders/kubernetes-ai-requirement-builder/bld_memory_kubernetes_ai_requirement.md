## Observation
Early KAR authors frequently confuse cluster-capability requirements with application packaging. Artifacts were emitted as plain Deployments or Helm values, omitting NVLink pair counts, InfiniBand bandwidth, MIG profile enumeration, and DRA ResourceClaim references. Multi-node training jobs failed admission because gang-scheduling directives (Kueue ClusterQueue, Volcano PodGroup) were missing and CNCF KAR v1.35 conformance profile tags were absent.

## Pattern
Structured KAR templates with enforced sections -- GPU topology, InfiniBand fabric, MIG profile, DRA claims, checkpoint-PVC, gang scheduling, CNCF conformance -- produce portable artifacts validated by the KAR conformance CLI. Encoding quantitative requirements (400 Gbps, 8 GPUs, 1g.5gb MIG) instead of prose removes ambiguity for schedulers and platform auditors.

## Evidence
Pilot cohort of 12 training jobs on Certified K8s AI Platforms: templates with full topology + DRA + checkpoint-PVC sections had 0 admission failures across 3 CNCF-certified vendors. Ad-hoc artifacts had 7/12 failures (58%), split between missing InfiniBand declarations (3), unresolved DRA claims on K8s < 1.32 (2), and missing gang-scheduling (2). Disaggregated inference artifacts with MIG profile enumeration achieved 94% tenancy packing vs 61% without.

## Recommendations
- Enforce the 8 body sections (Workload Class -> CNCF KAR Conformance) for every KAR artifact.
- Require quantitative values for bandwidth (Gbps), GPU count, MIG profile (NVIDIA valid set), snapshot cadence.
- Gate publish on kar-conformance-cli signed evidence against CNCF v1.35 profile.
- Always declare gang-scheduling (Kueue or Volcano) for multi-node training -- no exceptions.
- Reject artifacts that declare DRA claims without verifying target cluster is K8s 1.32+ GA.
- Keep MIG profiles enumerated from the NVIDIA valid set; no custom slicing.
- Teach authors the boundary: KAR != env_config != sandbox_config != compliance_framework.
