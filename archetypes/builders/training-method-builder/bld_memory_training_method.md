# Memory: training-method-builder Learning Record

## Boundary Decisions (Correct Routing)
| Situation | Route To | Not To |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| "How do I train a BERT classifier?" | training_method | finetune_config |
| "LoRA config for Llama-3-8B on instruction data" | finetune_config | training_method |
| "Document the GPT-4o training approach" | model_card | training_method |
| "Design reward function for RLHF" | reward_model | training_method |
| "Evaluate model on MMLU" | benchmark | training_method |
| "Set up DPO alignment training" | training_method (paradigm) + finetune_config (job) | neither alone |

## Common Mistakes
| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|-----------|
| Setting quality to a score | Always `quality: null` -- peer review assigns score |
| Using `finetune_config` for paradigm docs | training_method captures the METHODOLOGY, not the specific job |
| Omitting learning_paradigm field | Required -- always specify supervised/unsupervised/rl/etc. |
| Omitting compute_intensity | Required -- drives hardware planning downstream |
| Over-specifying job details | training_method is paradigm-level; fine-grained configs go in finetune_config |

## Quality Patterns That Score High
| Pattern | Why It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| Tables over prose for hyperparameters | Scannable, structured, machine-readable |
| Boundary conditions section | Disambiguates from 4 adjacent kinds |
| Compute profile with hardware specifics | Actionable, not abstract |
| Dataset format + field_mapping documented | Enables reproducibility |
| Evaluation metrics explicitly named | Prevents ambiguous success criteria |

## Known Edge Cases
| Case | Resolution |
|------|-----------|
| Multi-paradigm training (e.g., curriculum + RL) | Use `learning_paradigm: hybrid`, describe phases in body |
| Pre-training then fine-tuning | Create two artifacts: one training_method for pre-train, one for fine-tune |
| AutoML / NAS | training_method with `learning_paradigm: unsupervised`, note search space |
