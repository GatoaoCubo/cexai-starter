## Quality Gate

## Definition
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| metric | weighted soft score + all HARD gates pass |
| threshold | 7.0 to publish; 8.0 for pool; 9.0 for golden |
| operator | AND (all HARD) + weighted average (SOFT) |
| scope | any artifact with kind: training_method |

## HARD Gates
All must pass. Any failure = immediate reject.
| ID | Check | Fail Condition |
|----|-------|----------------|
| H01 | Frontmatter parses as valid YAML | Parse error on any field |
| H02 | ID matches ^p02_tm_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$ | Wrong prefix, uppercase, or bad chars |
| H03 | kind equals literal training_method | Any other kind value |
| H04 | pillar equals P02 | Wrong pillar |
| H05 | quality field is null | Any non-null value |
| H06 | learning_paradigm is one of: supervised / unsupervised / reinforcement / self_supervised / transfer / hybrid | Unlisted or missing value |

## SOFT Scoring
Total weights sum to 1.00.
| ID | Dimension | Weight | 10 pts | 5 pts | 0 pts |
|----|-----------|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| S01 | Paradigm specification | 0.20 | Paradigm, objective, label requirements all documented | Paradigm named, objective missing | No paradigm documented |
| S02 | Compute profile completeness | 0.15 | Hardware, memory, training time, parallelism all specified | Hardware specified, time/memory missing | Only intensity label, no details |
| S03 | Hyperparameter coverage | 0.15 | LR, batch_size, epochs, optimizer, scheduler all present | 3+ params present | Fewer than 3 params |
| S04 | Dataset spec quality | 0.15 | Source, size, format, field_mapping, preprocessing all specified | Source + format only | No dataset details |
| S05 | Evaluation strategy | 0.10 | Metrics, validation frequency, convergence criteria all specified | Metrics named, no convergence | No evaluation criteria |
| S06 | Boundary disambiguation | 0.10 | Clearly distinguishes from finetune_config / model_card / reward_model | Partial disambiguation | No boundary conditions |

**Score = sum(pts * weight) / sum(max_pts * weight) * 10**

## Actions
| Score | Tier | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| >= 9.0 | Golden | Publish as reference training spec |
| >= 8.0 | Skilled | Publish to pool + log pattern |
| >= 7.0 | Learning | Use but flag for improvement |
| < 7.0 | Rejected | Return to author with gate report |

## Bypass
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Conditions | Novel training paradigm with no established hyperparameter conventions |
| Approver | N01 researcher or domain expert |

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
