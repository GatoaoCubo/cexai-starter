# Architecture: training_method

## Pillar Placement
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Pillar | P02 (Model) |
| Rationale | training_method defines HOW a model learns -- belongs with model artifacts |
| Adjacent pillars | P07 (eval metrics), P01 (dataset knowledge), P11 (reward/feedback) |

## Naming Convention
| Component | Pattern | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Artifact ID | `p02_tm_[domain]` | `p02_tm_text_classification_bert` |
| File name | `p02_tm_[domain].md` | `p02_tm_text_classification_bert.md` |
| Builder ISOs | `bld_[type]_training_method.md` | `bld_instruction_training_method.md` |
| Directory | `P02_model/training_methods/` | standard pillar location |

## Size Constraints
| Component | Limit | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Artifact body | 4096 bytes | Concise specification, not documentation |
| Instruction ISO | 8192 bytes | Detailed process guidance needs more space |
| Other ISOs | 6144 bytes | Standard ISO limit |
| Frontmatter | No hard limit | YAML is compact |

## 8F Pipeline Integration
| Stage | training_method Role |
|-------|---------------------|
| F1 CONSTRAIN | kind=training_method, pillar=P02, schema loaded |
| F2 BECOME | training-method-builder loaded (13 ISOs) |
| F3 INJECT | kc_training_method + similar artifacts + domain KCs |
| F4 REASON | plan sections: overview + paradigm + compute + hyperparams + dataset + eval |
| F5 CALL | retriever finds existing specs, doctor verifies builder completeness |
| F6 PRODUCE | generate complete artifact with all required sections |
| F7 GOVERN | validate 10 HARD gates, density >= 0.85 |
| F8 COLLABORATE | save to P02, compile, commit, signal |

## Relationship Map
