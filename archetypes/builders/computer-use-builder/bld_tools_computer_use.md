# Tools: computer-use-builder

This ISO governs computer use: screen capture, mouse, and keyboard actions taken on behalf of the agent.
## Production Tools
| Tool | Purpose | When | Status |
|------|---------|------|--------|
| brain_query [MCP] | Search existing computer_use artifacts in pool | Phase 1 (check duplicates) | CONDITIONAL |
| validate_artifact.py | Generic artifact validator | Phase 3 | [PLANNED] |
| cex_forge.py | Generate artifact from seeds | Alternative compose | [PLANNED] |
## Data Sources
| Source | Path/URL | Data |
|--------|----------|------|
| CEX Schema | P04_tools/_schema.yaml | Field definitions, computer_use kind |
| CEX Examples | P04_tools/examples/ | Real computer_use artifacts |
| SEED_BANK | archetypes/SEED_BANK.yaml | Seeds for P04_computer_use |
| TAXONOMY | archetypes/TAXONOMY_LAYERS.yaml | Layer position, runtime layer |
| Anthropic Docs | docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/computer-use | Provider reference |
## Tool Permissions

| Category | Tools | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| ALLOWED | Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep | Explicitly permitted |
| DENIED | (none) | Explicitly blocked |
| EFFECTIVE | Bash, Edit, Glob, Grep, Read, Write | ALLOWED minus DENIED |

## Interim Validation
No automated validator exists yet. Manually check each QUALITY_GATES.md gate against
the produced artifact. Key checks: YAML parses, id pattern, resolution WxH format,
body <= 2048 bytes, quality == null, actions_supported listed.

## Pipeline Integration

1. Created via 8F pipeline from F1-Focus through F8-Furnish
2. Scored by cex_score across three structural layers
3. Compiled by cex_compile for structural validation
4. Retrieved by cex_retriever for context injection
5. Evolved by cex_evolve when quality regresses below target
