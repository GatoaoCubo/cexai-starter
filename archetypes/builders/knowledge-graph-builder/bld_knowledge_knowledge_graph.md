# Domain Knowledge: knowledge_graph

## Executive Summary
A knowledge_graph defines the relational structure for domain knowledge: entity types,
relation types, extraction prompts, storage backend, traversal strategies, and embedding
integration. It answers: "what entities exist in this domain, how are they related, and
how do we extract, store, and traverse those relationships?" Unlike flat vector search,
knowledge graphs enable multi-hop queries, theme summarization, and relationship discovery.

## Spec Table

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Pillar | P01 (Knowledge) |
| llm_function | INJECT |
| max_bytes | 8192 |
| Required frontmatter | 13 fields |
| Quality gates | 12 HARD + 12 SOFT |
| Entity types | 3-10 recommended (constrained whitelist) |
| Relation types | 5-15 recommended |
| Storage backends | neo4j, falkordb, in_memory, json |
| Traversal strategies | local, global, hybrid |
| Dedup strategies | exact, fuzzy, llm |
| Community detection | leiden, louvain, none |

## Framework Comparison

| Framework | Extraction | Storage | Traversal | Best for |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Microsoft GraphRAG | LLM community summaries | in_memory or neo4j | global + local | Large corpora, theme queries |
| LlamaIndex KG | LLM triplet extraction | in_memory or neo4j | local | Structured knowledge Q&A |
| LightRAG | Incremental LLM | in_memory | local + global | Frequently updated corpora |
| Neo4j + LangChain | External ETL | neo4j | Cypher QA | Complex relational queries |
| FalkorDB | External ETL | falkordb | Cypher | High-throughput, Redis ecosystem |
| Haystack KG | NLP pipeline | RDF store | SPARQL | Academic/semantic web patterns |

## Patterns

**Entity type whitelisting**: constrain extraction to 3-10 explicit types.
- More types = richer graph + noisier extraction. Find the minimum sufficient set.
- Include extraction hints (phrases that signal the type) and example instances.

**Relation type annotation**:
| Component | Required | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| name | YES | Machine-readable relation identifier |
| source_type | YES | Entity type at relation source |
| target_type | YES | Entity type at relation target |
| description | YES | Human-readable semantic meaning |
| directionality | YES | directed (A->B) or undirected (A--B) |

**Deduplication strategy selection**:
| Strategy | Accuracy | Cost | Use when |
|----------|----------|------|----------|
| exact | Low | Zero | All names are canonical (unlikely) |
| fuzzy | Medium | Low | Default -- variable naming conventions |
| llm | High | High | Precision matters, budget available |

**Traversal strategy selection**:
| Strategy | Query type answered | When to use |
|----------|--------------------|-----------:|
| local | "What do I know about entity X?" | Entity-centric retrieval |
| global | "What are the main themes/trends?" | Corpus-level synthesis |
| hybrid | Both types | Default recommendation |

**Storage backend selection**:
| Backend | Scale | Persistence | Query | Use when |
|---------|-------|------------|-------|---------|
| in_memory | < 10k nodes | None | Python API | Prototyping only |
| json | < 50k nodes | File | Python | Simple persistence |
| falkordb | < 1M nodes | Redis | Cypher | Production, high throughput |
| neo4j | Unlimited | ACID | Cypher | Production, complex queries |

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Unconstrained entity types | 100+ node types, useless graph | Define 3-10 type whitelist |
| No dedup strategy | Entity fragmentation, broken multi-hop | Add fuzzy dedup as minimum |
| No extraction prompt | Graph schema cannot be populated | Always include extraction template |
| Depth=1 traversal | Misses multi-hop relationships | Use depth 2-3 with pruning |
| in_memory in production | Data lost on restart | Use neo4j or falkordb for production |
| Relation without source/target type | Ambiguous relation semantics | Always annotate both ends |
| Schema with data instances | Mixes schema with data | Instances go in entity_memory (P10) |

## Application
1. Define domain: what questions must the graph answer?
2. Enumerate entity types: 3-10 types, constrained whitelist with extraction hints
3. Enumerate relation types: 5-15 types, with source/target/directionality
4. Design extraction prompt: schema-constrained LLM triplet extraction
5. Select storage backend: in_memory (prototype) -> falkordb or neo4j (production)
6. Select traversal strategy: hybrid is the safe default
7. Configure dedup: fuzzy is the safe default
8. Specify community detection: leiden for global traversal; none for local-only
9. Validate: entity_types and relation_types non-empty, all relations reference defined types
