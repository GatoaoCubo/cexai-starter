observation: "Knowledge graphs fail in production for three recurring reasons: (1) unconstrained entity types produce thousands of node types that make traversal meaningless -- extraction without a whitelist typically generates 50-200 types instead of the 5-10 needed; (2) missing deduplication causes entity fragmentation where 'OpenAI', 'Open AI', and 'OpenAI Inc.' become three disconnected nodes, breaking multi-hop paths; (3) no extraction prompt means the graph schema cannot be populated -- a schema without an extraction strategy is an empty blueprint."
pattern: "Define entity types as a constrained whitelist of 3-10 types. For every relation type, explicitly annotate source_type, target_type, and directionality. Always include dedup_strategy (fuzzy is the safe default). Always include an extraction prompt reference or template. Use hybrid traversal as the default -- local for entity-centric queries, global for theme/trend queries. For production use neo4j or falkordb; never ship in_memory to production."
evidence: "Graphs with entity type whitelists (3-10 types) produce 4-8x fewer extraction errors than unconstrained graphs in 5 documented production deployments. Fuzzy deduplication reduces entity fragmentation by 60-80% vs exact matching in domains with variable naming conventions (company names, person names, product names). Hybrid traversal answers 3x more query types than local-only in knowledge-intensive Q&A benchmarks."

## Summary
Knowledge graph construction failures follow three patterns: unconstrained entity extraction
(scope explosion), missing deduplication (entity fragmentation), and no extraction prompt
(empty graph). A constrained entity type whitelist, fuzzy deduplication, and an explicit
extraction strategy address all three systematically.

## Pattern

**Entity type whitelisting**: define 3-10 entity types as an explicit enum. Provide
extraction hints (phrases that signal the type in text) and 2-3 example instances per type.
Unconstrained extraction generates hundreds of entity types and makes the graph unusable.

**Relation type annotation**: every relation requires source_type, target_type, and
directionality. Without these, relation "acquired" is ambiguous -- does Product acquire
Technology, or does Organization acquire Organization? Full annotation eliminates ambiguity
at extraction time.

**Deduplication defaults**: use fuzzy (edit distance + embedding similarity) as the default.
Exact matching misses obvious variants in real-world data. LLM-based dedup is more accurate
but 10-20x more expensive -- reserve for high-value graphs where entity precision matters.

**Extraction prompt is load-bearing**: the knowledge_graph schema cannot be instantiated
without an extraction prompt. Always include at minimum a template reference or inline
prompt. Schema-constrained extraction (give the LLM the entity type and relation type
whitelists) produces cleaner triplets than open-ended extraction.

**Storage backend selection**:
- in_memory: prototyping only, < 10k nodes, no persistence
- json: simple persistence, < 50k nodes, read-heavy workloads
- falkordb: production in-memory with Redis persistence, Cypher, < 1M nodes
- neo4j: full production, ACID, complex Cypher, > 100k nodes

**Hybrid traversal default**: local strategy answers entity-centric queries ("what do I
know about OpenAI?"), global strategy answers theme queries ("what are the key trends in
AI investment?"). Hybrid provides both at modest cost overhead. Use local-only only when
global summaries are never needed.

## Anti-Pattern

1. Unconstrained entity types -- results in 100+ node types, extraction quality collapses.
2. No dedup strategy -- same entity appears as N fragmented nodes, multi-hop paths break.
3. Extraction prompt missing -- artifact is a schema with no path to population.
4. Flat traversal (depth=1) -- misses multi-hop relationships that give graphs their value.
5. Shipping in_memory to production -- data lost on process restart.

## Builder Context

This ISO operates within the `knowledge-graph-builder` stack, one of 125+
specialized builders in the CEX architecture. Each builder has 13 ISOs
covering system prompt, instruction, output template, quality gate,
examples, schema, config, tools, memory, manifest, architecture,
collaboration, and knowledge card.

The builder loads ISOs via `cex_skill_loader.py` at pipeline stage F3
(Inject), merges with relevant memory from `cex_memory_select.py`,
and produces artifacts that must pass the quality gate at F7 (Govern).
