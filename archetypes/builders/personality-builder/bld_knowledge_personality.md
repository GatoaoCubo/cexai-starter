# KC: personality

## Definition
A `personality` is a hot-swappable voice/tone/values overlay applied to an agent at runtime.
Implementing the persona layer pattern , a personality specifies
HOW the agent communicates -- its register, verbosity, humor, core values, sample phrases,
and forbidden phrases -- WITHOUT altering what the agent can do or how its memory works.

## Origin
**persona layer pattern** -- multi-agent introduced the concept of a
`SOUL.md` file that rides alongside an agent's system prompt, injecting a persistent persona.
CEX adapts this as the `personality` kind: a lightweight, swappable spec that can be
activated or deactivated at runtime without restarting the agent.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| register | Communication style: formal, casual, technical, playful |
| verbosity | Response length preference: terse, balanced, verbose |
| humor | Levity calibration: off, dry, warm |
| values | 3-5 core principles driving persona behavior |
| tone_examples | Verbatim sample phrases the persona would say |
| anti_patterns | Phrases this persona would NEVER say |
| hot_swap | Instantaneous persona change via /personality command |

## When to use
- When an agent must adapt voice for different audiences (technical vs. casual)
- When building multi-persona systems (researcher mode, coach mode, hacker mode)
- When implementing SOUL.md-style persona override in a multi-agent pattern
- When separating "who the agent is" (agent kind) from "how it speaks right now" (personality kind)

## Boundaries
| Kind | Relationship | Boundary |
|------|-------------|----------|
| agent | Carries the active personality | agent = full spec; personality = voice only |
| agent_profile | May reference active personality | agent_profile = runtime AI config; personality = voice override |
| system_prompt | May instruct "use personality X" | system_prompt = full prompt; personality = one injected layer |
| lens | Domain perspective | lens = routing + domain knowledge; personality = voice style |

## Activation Pattern
```
User: /personality researcher
Agent: loads p02_per_researcher.md
       injects voice.register=technical, verbosity=verbose, humor=dry
       applies values and tone_examples to next responses
User: /personality default
Agent: reverts to default voice profile
```
