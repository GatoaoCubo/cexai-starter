# Collaboration: enum-def-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "what are the finite named values for this field, and what does each mean?"
I do not define types with methods or structural constraints. I do not build validation contracts.
I specify closed value sets so schemas, validators, and input contracts can reference a single authoritative list.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Schema Definition"
```
  1. enum-def-builder    -> "finite value sets (status, category, state)"
  2. type-def-builder    -> "abstract type structures that reference enums"
  3. input-schema-builder -> "validation contract that uses enum_def as field constraint"
```
### Crew: "API Contract"
```
  1. enum-def-builder    -> "request/response field enumerations"
  2. input-schema-builder -> "full request body schema referencing enums"
  3. validator-builder   -> "pass/fail rules enforcing enum membership"
```
### Crew: "Domain Model"
```
  1. enum-def-builder    -> "domain state machines and category sets"
  2. type-def-builder    -> "domain entities with enum fields"
  3. glossary-entry-builder -> "prose definitions for each enum value"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: domain context, field name, list of candidate values
- optional: default value, deprecated values, framework target (Pydantic, Zod, etc.)
### I Produce
- enum_def artifact (.md + .yaml frontmatter)
- committed to: `cex/P06_schema/examples/p06_enum_{slug}.md`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons
## Builders I Depend On
None — independent builder (layer 0). Enums can be defined standalone before any type or schema references them.
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| type-def-builder | Types reference enum_def for field constraints |
| input-schema-builder | Input schemas use enum_def to constrain field values |
| validator-builder | Validators check membership against enum_def value lists |
| glossary-entry-builder | Glossary entries may document enum values as domain terms |
