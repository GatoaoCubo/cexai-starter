## Context
The skill-builder produces `skill` artifacts — reusable capabilities defined as ordered
phases with a trigger that activates them. A skill encapsulates a repeatable process:
it has a clear entry point (trigger), a structured execution path (phases), and a defined
output. Skills are distinct from agents (which have identity) and action prompts (which are
single-turn instructions).
**Input contract**:
- `{{skill_name}}`: kebab-case capability name (e.g. `web-search`, `code-review`)
- `{{trigger_type}}`: one of `slash_command`, `keyword`, `event`, `agent-invoked`
- `{{trigger_value}}`: the exact trigger string (e.g. `/search`, `"review this"`, `on_deploy`)
- `{{user_invocable}}`: boolean — can a human trigger this directly?
- `{{phases_raw}}`: comma-separated phase names or free-text describing the process
- `{{input_description}}`: what the skill receives
- `{{output_description}}`: what the skill produces
**Output contract**: A single `skill` Markdown file with YAML frontmatter, 2-6 atomic
phases each with Input/Action/Output blocks, when_to_use and when_not_to_use lists,
concrete invocation examples, anti-patterns section, and metrics section.
**Boundaries**:
- Skill handles reusable phase-based capabilities only.
- Agent identity (who the agent IS) belongs in a system-prompt artifact.
- Single-turn task instructions belong in an action_prompt artifact.
- Event-driven hooks (triggered by file/tool events) are a separate hook artifact.
- MCP server tool exposure belongs in an mcp_server artifact.

## Builder Integration

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| ISO | 1 of 13 builder ISOs |
| Loader | `cex_skill_loader.py` |
| Pipeline | Injected at F3 (Compose) |

## Template Loading

```yaml
# This instruction is ISO 3 of 13 in the builder stack
loader: cex_skill_loader.py
injection_point: F3_compose
priority: high
```

```bash
# Verify instruction loads correctly
python _tools/cex_skill_loader.py --verify skill
```
