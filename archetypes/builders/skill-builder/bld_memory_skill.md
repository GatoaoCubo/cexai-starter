# Memory: skill-builder

## Learnings
1. Skills are NOT agents — they have no identity, only behavior
2. Skills are NOT workflows — they are reusable across workflows
3. The boundary between skill and workflow: a skill is invokable, a workflow is sequential
4. Universal term: Alexa Skills, Semantic Kernel Skills, AgentSkills.io

## What Worked
1. Defining trigger conditions clearly prevents misuse
2. Phases (setup → execute → validate → cleanup) give consistent structure
3. Anti-patterns section is high-value — prevents common mistakes

## What Failed
1. Over-scoping: trying to make one skill do too much → split into focused skills
2. Missing boundary: skill that overlaps with agent identity → strip identity, keep behavior
