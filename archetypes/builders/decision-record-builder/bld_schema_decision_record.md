| pillar | literal "P08" | YES | - | Pillar assignment |
| title | string <= 80ch | YES | - | Human-readable decision title |
| status | enum: proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded | YES | proposed | Lifecycle state |
| context | string | YES | - | Why this decision arose |
| decision | string | YES | - | What was decided |
| version | semver string | YES | "1.0.0" | Artifact versioning |
| created | date YYYY-MM-DD | YES | - | Creation date |

| author | string | YES | - | Producer identity |
| quality | null | YES | null | Never self-score |

| date_decided | date YYYY-MM-DD | OPT | - | When decision was finalized |
## ID Pattern
Regex: `^p08_adr_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$`
Rule: id MUST equal filename stem.
## Body Structure (required sections)
1. `## Context` — problem, forces, and circumstances that made this decision necessary
2. `## Options Considered` — each alternative with pros and cons
3. `## Decision` — what was chosen and the primary rationale
4. `## Consequences` — positive, negative, and neutral effects; known tradeoffs
## Constraints
- max_bytes: 4096 (body — ADRs need full context to be useful)
- naming: p08_adr_{slug}.md (single file)
- machine_format: yaml (compiled artifact)
- id == filename stem
- status MUST be one of: proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded
- context and decision MUST be present and non-empty
- quality: null always
- NO implementation code in body — rationale and record only
- If status == superseded: superseded_by MUST reference a valid ADR id
