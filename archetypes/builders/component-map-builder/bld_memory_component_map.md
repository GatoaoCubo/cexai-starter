## Summary
A component map's value is making hidden dependencies visible. Orphan components — listed in the component table but absent from connections — destroy that value. Orphans signal either truly isolated components (rare, annotate explicitly) or omitted connections (common, dangerous).
The second most common failure is undirected connections ("A relates to B"): structural information without operational information. Direction is what makes a map reasoned from vs. merely looked at.
## Pattern
**No orphans. Explicit direction. Bounded scope.**
No-orphan rule: after writing both the component table and the connection table, verify every component_id in the component table appears at least once as source or target in the connection table. Any component with no connections must be annotated explicitly as `isolated: true` with a justification.
Connection direction types:
1. data_flow: data moves from source to target (A sends records to B)
2. dependency: source cannot function without target (A requires B to be running)
3. signal: source sends event/trigger to target (A emits events consumed by B)
4. produces: source creates target as output artifact (A generates B)
5. consumes: source reads or uses target (A reads from B)
Scope boundary rules:
1. 3-15 components per map. Fewer than 3: use a agent_group spec instead. More than 15: split by domain.
2. Scope statement must name what is explicitly excluded, not just what is included.
3. Right-size example: "Brain search infrastructure: indexing, embedding, retrieval. Excludes: UI layer, API routing, authentication."
Component table required columns: id, name, type, owner, description (one sentence). No prose beyond the table.
## Anti-Pattern
1. Orphan components without `isolated: true` annotation (conceals dependencies).
2. Undirected connections without type annotation (structurally present, operationally useless).
3. Scope too broad ("the whole system") — split by domain.
4. Scope too narrow ("just the BM25 index") — use a spec for single-component documentation.
5. Prose connections instead of a table (kills density; S08 fail).
6. Confusing component map (structured data) with diagram (visual rendering).
7. component_count not matching actual table rows (H06 fail).
## Context
Orphan detection emerged from maps where components were listed to signal existence without documenting connections — creating false completeness while hiding the actual dependency graph.
Ownership column is required for incident response: knowing who owns a component halves time-to-contact when it is implicated in a failure. Health status column (optional): current, degraded, deprecated, unknown — doubles as a live dashboard when kept current.
