## Examples

## Golden Example
```markdown
---
title: "AI Model Playground Config"
description: "Config for evaluating LLMs in a collaborative research environment"
vendor: "Hugging Face"
version: "2.1"
parameters:
  model: "google/flan-t5-xl"
  max_tokens: 2048
  rate_limit: 100
  logging: true
  evaluation_metrics: ["accuracy", "latency", "hallucination"]
---

### Overview
Configures a collaborative evaluation environment for large language models with real-time metrics.

### Setup
- Requires Hugging Face Spaces API key
- Uses Google Cloud for model hosting
- Integrates with AWS for data storage

### Usage
1. Load model from Hugging Face Model Hub
2. Enable interactive evaluation with Jupyter widgets
3. Collect metrics via Prometheus exporter

### Security
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Data anonymization pipeline
- Session expiration after 2 hours

### Evaluation
- Compare against baseline models
- Track user feedback via form submission
- Export results to BigQuery
```

## Anti-Example 1: Missing Evaluation Metrics
```markdown
---
title: "Incomplete Playground Config"
description: "Basic config without evaluation parameters"
vendor: "ExampleCo"
version: "0.5"
parameters:
  model: "meta/llama-2"
  max_tokens: 512
---
```
## Why it fails
Lacks essential evaluation metrics and security parameters required for proper product evaluation. Missing metrics makes it impossible to measure model performance, and no security settings expose the playground to misuse.

## Anti-Example 2: Sandbox Configuration
```markdown
---
title: "Misconfigured Playground"
description: "Includes sandbox isolation parameters"
vendor: "SomeCorp"
version: "1.0"
parameters:
  model: "openai/gpt-3.5"
  container_image: "nginx:latest"
  network_policy: "deny-all"
---
```
## Why it fails
Includes sandbox-specific isolation parameters (container_image, network_policy) that violate the playground spec. Playground configs should focus on interactive evaluation, not system isolation. This conflates playground with sandbox specifications.

### H_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (HARD)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (min 3 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream or sibling reference
- Gate: REJECT if < 3 entries (auto-populated by cex_wikilink.py at F6.5)

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
