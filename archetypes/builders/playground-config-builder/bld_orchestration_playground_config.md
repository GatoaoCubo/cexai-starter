## Crew Role  
Configures playground environments by assembling spec-compliant settings, ensuring consistency across execution contexts.  

## Receives From  
| Builder       | What                  | Format      |  
|---------------|-----------------------|-------------|  
| Spec Author   | Playground spec       | YAML        |  
| Template Lib  | Config templates      | JSON        |  
| Env Manager   | Environment variables | Key-value   |  

## Produces For  
| Builder         | What                  | Format      |  
|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------|  
| Execution Engine| Runtime config        | JSON        |  
| UI Component    | Playground metadata   | Config file |  
| Monitoring Sys  | Telemetry endpoints   | API spec    |  

## Boundary  
Does NOT enforce security isolation (handled by sandbox_spec) or build UIs (handled by interactive_demo).
