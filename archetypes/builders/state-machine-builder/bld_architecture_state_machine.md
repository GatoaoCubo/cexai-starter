## Component Inventory

| Name | Role | Owner | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| entity | Entity whose lifecycle is being modeled | state_machine | required |
| initial_state | Starting state (pseudo-state) | state_machine | required |
| states | Set of all named states | state_machine | required |
| final_states | Terminal states (entity lifecycle ends) | state_machine | required |
| transitions | List of (from, event, to, guard, action) tuples | state_machine | required |
| transition.from_state | State this transition originates from | transition | required |
| transition.event | Event that triggers transition | transition | required |
| transition.to_state | Destination state | transition | required |
| transition.guard | Boolean condition gating the transition | transition | optional |
| transition.action | Side-effect executed on transition | transition | optional |
| state.entry_action | Action executed when entering state | state | optional |
| state.exit_action | Action executed when leaving state | state | optional |
| workflow | DAG of sequential/parallel steps (separate kind) | P12 (separate kind) | external |
| process_manager | Event coordinator for long-running processes | P12 (separate kind) | external |

## State Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Initial | Starting state; only one allowed | DRAFT, PENDING |
| Intermediate | Can transition in and out | ACTIVE, SUBMITTED |
| Final | No outgoing transitions | TERMINATED, DELETED |
| Composite | Contains sub-states (UML hierarchical) | PROCESSING (has sub-states) |

## Boundary Table

| state_machine IS | state_machine IS NOT |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Formal FSM with deterministic transitions | Ordered sequence of steps (that is workflow) |
| Entity lifecycle governance | Event orchestration across multiple processes (that is process_manager) |
| Guard-conditioned state changes | Task scheduling (that is schedule) |
| UML statechart / XState definition | BPMN process diagram (that is workflow) |

## Layer Map

| Layer | Components | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| identity | entity, initial_state, final_states | Define what entity and lifecycle scope |
| state set | states | All possible states the entity can be in |
| transitions | from, event, to, guard | Define all valid state changes |
| actions | entry_action, exit_action, transition.action | Side-effects on state changes |
