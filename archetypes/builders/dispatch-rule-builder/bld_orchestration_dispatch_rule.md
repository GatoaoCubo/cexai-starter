# Collaboration: dispatch-rule-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "which target should receive this kind of task, and under what conditions?"
I do not execute tasks. I do not define handoff instructions.
I produce routing policies so orchestrators can dispatch work to the correct target.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Full Dispatch Setup"
```
  1. dispatch-rule-builder -> "routing rules (keywords -> target -> fallback)"
  2. fallback-chain-builder -> "degradation path when primary target fails"
  3. dag-builder -> "execution order for multi-target dispatch"
  4. handoff-builder -> "delegation instructions for each target"
```
### Crew: "Routing Table Construction"
```
  1. component-map-builder -> "inventory of available targets"
  2. dispatch-rule-builder -> "routing rule per domain scope"
  3. interface-builder -> "contracts between router and targets"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: domain scope, target agent/service, keywords (5-12)
- optional: model preference, priority, confidence threshold, fallback target
### I Produce
- dispatch_rule artifact (.yaml frontmatter + .md body, max 3072 bytes)
- committed to: `cex/P12/examples/p12_dr_{scope}.yaml`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons
## Builders I Depend On
- component-map-builder: provides target inventory for routing decisions
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| handoff-builder | Creates delegation instructions for dispatched targets |
| fallback-chain-builder | Defines degradation when dispatch target fails |
| dag-builder | Models dispatch dependencies in execution graphs |
