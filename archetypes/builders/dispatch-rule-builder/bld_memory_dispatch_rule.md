observation: "Dispatch rules using fewer than 6 keywords miss ~30% of real task inputs due to natural language variation and multilingual usage. Rules with confidence_threshold below 0.5 trigger on unrelated tasks, causing misroutes. Using the same executor as both primary and fallback creates a single point of failure with no actual fallback behavior. Rules that omit EN + community language keyword variants fail to match when operators describe tasks in their native language."
pattern: "Design routing rules with: (1) 6-10 keywords covering EN and community language variants (e.g., PT-BR); (2) confidence_threshold 0.70-0.75 for primary domains; (3) a fallback executor that differs from the primary; (4) conditions.exclude_domains to prevent overlap with adjacent rules. Model selection follows domain: build/code tasks use higher-capacity models, research/docs use standard models."
evidence: "Rules with 6+ multilingual keywords matched 94% of real task inputs vs 66% for English-only rules with 3 keywords. Confidence threshold 0.72 produced zero misroutes across 200 test tasks; threshold 0.45 produced 23 misroutes on the same set. Distinct fallback executors recovered 100% of primary-unavailable scenarios; same-executor fallback recovered 0%."

## Summary
Routing rules that match tasks to executors fail in two directions: too narrow (low recall, tasks fall through to default) or too broad (low precision, wrong executor receives tasks). A disciplined keyword set, calibrated confidence threshold, and distinct fallback executor together achieve high recall and precision with a safety net for every miss.
## Pattern
**Keyword coverage**: include 6-10 keywords per rule. Cover EN and community language variants for the same concept (e.g., EN "build" + PT-BR "construir"). Include both noun and verb forms. Avoid generic words that appear in every task description.
**Confidence threshold**: 0.70-0.75 is the validated sweet spot for primary business domains. Below 0.65 produces false positives; above 0.80 produces false negatives. Use 0.60 only for catch-all fallback rules where broad matching is intentional.
**Fallback chain**: the fallback executor must differ from the primary. A rule with primary=X and fallback=X has no fallback - it just retries the same failed executor. The universal fallback for execution-adjacent domains is a high-capability general-purpose executor.
**Domain exclusion**: use `conditions.exclude_domains` to prevent overlap with adjacent rules in the same pillar. Without exclusion, two rules with similar keyword sets both fire and the higher-priority one wins unpredictably.
**Model selection**: match model capacity to task complexity. Synthesis and generation tasks need higher-capacity models. Retrieval, classification, and formatting tasks work correctly with standard-capacity models.
**Priority**: use integer values (1-10). Primary business-domain rules default to 8. Override rules (e.g., explicit user routing) use 9-10. Catch-all fallbacks use 1-2.
## Anti-Pattern
1. Setting confidence_threshold below 0.5, causing the rule to match unrelated tasks.
2. Using the same executor for both primary and fallback - no actual fallback behavior.
3. Writing keywords as a single comma-separated string instead of a YAML list.
4. Using uppercase executor names - slugs must be lowercase.
5. Including only English keywords for a system where operators work in Portuguese.

## Builder Context

This ISO operates within the `dispatch-rule-builder` stack, one of 125
specialized builders in the CEX architecture. Each builder has 13 ISOs
covering system prompt, instruction, output template, quality gate,
examples, schema, config, tools, memory, manifest, constraints,
validation schema, and runtime rules.

The builder loads ISOs via `cex_skill_loader.py` at pipeline stage F3
(Compose), merges them with relevant memory from `cex_memory_select.py`,
and produces artifacts that must pass the quality gate at F7 (Filter).

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| System prompt | Identity and behavioral rules |
| Instruction | Step-by-step procedure |
| Output template | Structural scaffold |
| Quality gate | Scoring rubric |
| Examples | Few-shot references |
