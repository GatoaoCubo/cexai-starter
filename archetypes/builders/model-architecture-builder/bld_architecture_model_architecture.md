# Architecture: model_architecture

## Pillar Placement
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Pillar | P02 (Model) |
| Rationale | model_architecture defines neural network structure -- core model artifact |
| Adjacent pillars | P07 (benchmarks), P01 (domain knowledge), P09 (serving config) |

## Naming Convention
| Component | Pattern | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Artifact ID | `p02_ma_[family]_[scale]` | `p02_ma_llama_7b` |
| File name | `p02_ma_[family]_[scale].md` | `p02_ma_llama_7b.md` |
| Builder ISOs | `bld_[type]_model_architecture.md` | `bld_instruction_model_architecture.md` |
| Directory | `P02_model/architectures/` | standard pillar location |

## Size Constraints
| Component | Limit | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Artifact body | 4096 bytes | Concise spec, not implementation |
| Instruction ISO | 8192 bytes | Process guidance needs more space |
| Other ISOs | 6144 bytes | Standard ISO limit |

## 8F Pipeline Integration
| Stage | model_architecture Role |
|-------|------------------------|
| F1 CONSTRAIN | kind=model_architecture, pillar=P02, schema loaded |
| F2 BECOME | model-architecture-builder loaded (13 ISOs) |
| F3 INJECT | kc_model_architecture + similar specs + domain KCs |
| F4 REASON | plan sections: overview + layers + connectivity + params + compute |
| F5 CALL | retriever finds similar architectures |
| F6 PRODUCE | complete artifact with all required sections |
| F7 GOVERN | 10 HARD gates, density >= 0.85 |
| F8 COLLABORATE | save to P02, compile, commit, signal |

## Relationship Map
```

  |-- used_by --> finetune_config (training job spec)
  |-- documented_in --> model_card (trained model docs)
  |-- served_by --> model_provider (runtime routing)
  |-- trained_via --> training_method (learning paradigm)
  |-- evaluated_by --> benchmark (performance metrics)
```
