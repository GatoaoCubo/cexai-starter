# Instructions: How to Produce a compression_config
## Phase 1: RESEARCH
1. Identify the target agent or scope: which agent or system component needs compression?
2. Determine the context window size and model token limit for the target
3. Catalog the message types present in typical conversations: system_prompt, user, assistant, tool_call, tool_result, pinned, observation
4. Classify each message type by priority: critical (never compress), high (compress last), medium (compress when needed), low (compress first)
5. Determine the trigger ratio: at what percentage of token budget should compression activate? (recommended: 0.80-0.90)
6. Select primary strategy: summarize (semantic), truncate_oldest (positional), rolling_window (sliding), priority_keep (weighted), or tiered (multi-stage)
7. Define decay weights: how quickly does each message type lose priority as it ages?
8. Check existing compression_configs via brain_query [IF MCP] for the same scope — do not duplicate
## Phase 2: COMPOSE
1. Read SCHEMA.md — source of truth for all fields
2. Read OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md — fill the template following SCHEMA constraints
3. Fill all required frontmatter fields; set `quality: null` — never self-score
4. Write **Strategy Specification** section: primary strategy, trigger ratio, target ratio after compression
5. Write **Preserve Types** section: list of message types that are never compressed, with rationale
6. Write **Decay Weights** section: table mapping message types to priority multipliers and age decay curves
7. Write **Compression Pipeline** section: ordered stages from least lossy to most lossy
8. Write **Token Accounting** section: how tokens are counted, what counts toward the budget, overhead estimates
9. Confirm body <= 4096 bytes
## Phase 3: VALIDATE
1. Check QUALITY_GATES.md — verify each HARD gate manually
2. Confirm YAML frontmatter parses without errors
3. Confirm `id` matches `^p10_cc_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$`
4. Confirm strategy is one of: summarize, truncate_oldest, rolling_window, priority_keep, tiered
5. Confirm trigger_ratio is between 0.50 and 0.99
6. Confirm preserve_types includes at minimum: system_prompt
7. Confirm decay_weights are defined for at least 3 message types
8. Confirm `quality` is null
9. Confirm body <= 4096 bytes
10. Cross-check: is this a compression strategy? If this is a token allocation it belongs in `token_budget`. If this is state persistence it belongs in `session_backend`. If this is long-term memory it belongs in memory config. This artifact specifies HOW to compress, not HOW MUCH to allocate or WHERE to store.
11. If score < 8.0: revise in the same pass before outputting
