# Tools: reasoning-trace-builder
## Production Tools
| Tool | Purpose | When | Status |
|------|---------|------|--------|
| `cex_8f_runner.py` | 8F pipeline runner — F4 REASON produces reasoning state | Trace capture during build | ACTIVE |
| `cex_sdk/reasoning/tracer.py` | SDK tracer that captures live reasoning into trace format | Runtime trace generation | ACTIVE |
| `cex_compile.py` | Compiles .md/.yaml to indexed artifacts | Post-save compilation | ACTIVE |
| `cex_doctor.py` | Builder health check — validates trace structure | Validation phase | ACTIVE |
| `cex_memory_update.py` | Memory append for low-confidence trace feedback | Feedback loop trigger | CONDITIONAL |
| `cex_score.py` | Peer review scoring (--apply) | Quality assessment | CONDITIONAL |
## Runtime Interfaces
| Interface | Path | Use |
|-----------|------|-----|
| Trace output directory | `P03_prompt/compiled/` | write compiled YAML trace files |
| P03 schema | `P03_prompt/_schema.yaml` | naming, format, limits |
| Trace template | `P03_prompt/templates/tpl_reasoning_trace.md` | human reference for trace structure |
| Memory feedback | `.cex/learning_records/` | write learning records for low-confidence traces |
| SDK tracer | `cex_sdk/reasoning/tracer.py` | runtime trace capture integration |
| 8F state | `cex_8f_runner.py` state.reasoning | F4 REASON state that feeds traces |
## Tool Permissions

| Category | Tools | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| ALLOWED | Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep | Explicitly permitted |
| DENIED | (none) | Explicitly blocked |
| EFFECTIVE | Bash, Edit, Glob, Grep, Read, Write | ALLOWED minus DENIED |

## Interim Validation
Until a dedicated reasoning_trace validator exists, validate manually:
- filename matches `p03_rt_{agent}_{timestamp}.yaml`
- YAML parses without errors
- required fields present: agent, intent, steps, conclusion, confidence, timestamp
- each step has thought, evidence, confidence
- confidence values in range 0.0-1.0
- overall confidence is geometric mean of step confidences
- no execution instructions or workflow logic in trace body
- total size <= 8192 bytes
