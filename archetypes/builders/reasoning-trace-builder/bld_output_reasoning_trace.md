## Derivation Notes
1. The first six body fields (agent, intent, steps, conclusion, confidence, timestamp) are required
2. `alternatives_rejected` is strongly recommended but technically optional
3. `duration_ms`, `context`, and `trigger` are optional extensions
4. Omit absent optional fields instead of filling with placeholder strings
5. Each step MUST have thought + evidence + confidence — never skip evidence
6. Overall confidence is geometric mean: `(c1 * c2 * ... * cn) ^ (1/n)`
7. Keep the trace focused: no instructions, no tool calls, no workflow steps
