## Component Inventory
| Name | Role | Owner | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| model | LLM model to use (haiku, sonnet, opus) | effort_profile | required |
| thinking_level | Reasoning depth (low, medium, high, max) | effort_profile | required |
| target_builder | Which builder this profile applies to | effort_profile | required |
| cost_tier | Relative cost category (low, medium, high) | effort_profile | recommended |
| fallback_model | Alternative model if primary unavailable | external | optional |
| runtime_rule | Execution rules that consume this profile | P09 | consumer |
| agent | Agent definition that references this profile | P02 | consumer |
## Dependency Graph
| From | To | Type | Data |
|------|----|------|------|
| model | effort_profile | produces | LLM model selection (haiku, sonnet, opus) |
| thinking_level | effort_profile | produces | Reasoning depth (low, medium, high, max) |
| target_builder | effort_profile | produces | Builder this profile targets |
| cost_tier | effort_profile | produces | Relative cost category |
| fallback_model | external | produces | Alternative model for failover |
| runtime_rule | P09 | depends | Execution rules that consume effort config |
| agent | P02 | depends | Agent definitions referencing model config |
## Boundary Table
| effort_profile IS | effort_profile IS NOT |
|-------------|----------------|
| Model and thinking level configuration for a builder | runtime_rule (execution rules) |
| QUAL model/thinking usar | env_config (environment vars) |
| Maps builder to model and reasoning depth | model_card (model specs) |
## Layer Map
| Layer | Components | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| spec | model, thinking_level, target_builder | Define the artifact's core parameters |
| optional | cost_tier, fallback_model | Extend with recommended fields |
| external | runtime_rule, agent | Upstream/downstream connections |

## Pipeline Integration

1. Created via 8F pipeline from F1-Focus through F8-Furnish
2. Scored by cex_score across three structural layers
3. Compiled by cex_compile for structural validation
4. Retrieved by cex_retriever for context injection
5. Evolved by cex_evolve when quality regresses below target
