observation: "effort_profile artifacts require explicit model + thinking level pairs with cost/quality rationale. Vague levels like 'smart' cause dispatch failures."
pattern: "Map builder to concrete model (haiku/sonnet/opus) and thinking level (low/medium/high/max). Validate against SCHEMA.md. Keep body under 4096 bytes."
evidence: "Pattern extracted from Anthropic model tiers, Claude thinking budget documentation, and production dispatch configurations across 99 builder types."

## Summary
Effort and thinking level configuration for builder execution — maps builder to model and reasoning depth.
The difference between a useful effort_profile and a useless one is concrete model/thinking pairs with rationale versus placeholder text.
## Pattern
**Concrete model + thinking level with rationale.**
Every configuration must have: target builder, model, thinking level, and why that combination was chosen.
Required body sections: Overview, Configuration, Levels, Integration.
Body budget: 4096 bytes max.
## Anti-Pattern
1. Over-provisioning: Using opus/max for simple formatting tasks wastes tokens and money
2. Under-provisioning: Using haiku/low for complex reasoning tasks produces garbage output
3. Missing escalation: No fallback when primary model fails or is unavailable
4. Ignoring cost: No cost awareness leads to budget blowout on batch runs
## Context
The 4096-byte body limit keeps effort_profile artifacts focused. Fill required fields first,
then add recommended fields if space permits. Always set quality: null.
