# Domain Knowledge: effort_profile
## Executive Summary
Effort and thinking level configuration for builder execution — maps builder to model and reasoning depth. Produced as P09 artifacts with concrete model/thinking pairs and rationale.
## Spec Table
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Pillar | P09 |
| llm_function | CONSTRAIN |
| Max bytes | 4096 |
| Density min | 0.8 |
| Machine format | yaml |
## Patterns
| Pattern | Description | When to use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Minimal effort | haiku + low thinking | Simple formatting, templating, boilerplate tasks |
| Balanced effort | sonnet + medium thinking | Standard builds, moderate complexity, good cost/quality |
| Deep effort | opus + high thinking | Complex reasoning, multi-step planning, architecture |
| Maximum effort | opus + max thinking | Critical artifacts, orchestration, novel problems |
## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why it fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| Over-provisioning | Using opus/max for simple tasks wastes tokens and budget |
| Under-provisioning | Using haiku/low for complex reasoning produces garbage output |
| Missing escalation | No fallback model when primary is unavailable or rate-limited |
| Ignoring cost | No cost tier awareness leads to budget blowout on batch runs |
## Application
1. Identify the target builder and its typical task complexity
2. Select apownte model/thinking pattern from the table above
3. Define concrete parameter values with rationale
4. Validate against SCHEMA.md required fields
5. Check body size <= 4096 bytes
6. Verify id matches `^p09_effort_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$`
