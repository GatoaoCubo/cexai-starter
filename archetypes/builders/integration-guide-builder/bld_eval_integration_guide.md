title: "Stripe + AWS Integration Guide for SaaS Platforms"
description: "End-to-end integration guide for connecting Stripe payments with AWS infrastructure for enterprise SaaS onboarding"
audience: "Platform partners, enterprise account managers"
tags: ["payment-processing", "cloud-integration", "onboarding"]
# Stripe & AWS Integration Guide
## Overview
This guide enables seamless integration between Stripe's payment processing and AWS infrastructure for enterprise SaaS onboarding. Targeting organizations requiring PCI-DSS compliance and automated scaling.
## Prerequisites
- Stripe account with API keys (live/test)
- AWS account with IAM roles configured
- Node.js 16+ environment
## Integration Steps
1. **API Setup**
   Configure Stripe Webhook endpoints in AWS API Gateway with Lambda triggers for real-time payment events.
2. **Data Pipeline**
   Use AWS Glue to transform Stripe's JSON events into Parquet format for storage in S3.
3. **Security**
   Implement AWS KMS encryption for payment data at rest, with IAM policies restricting access to payment data.
4. **Monitoring**
   Set up CloudWatch metrics for payment processing latency and error rates.
## Best Practices
- Use Stripe's Radar for fraud detection before AWS processing
- Implement automated scaling in EC2 for high-volume payment periods
- Maintain audit logs in CloudTrail for compliance
## Support
Contact Stripe's enterprise team at enterprise-support@stripe.com and AWS support via AWS Premium Support.

title: "Generic Payment Integration Guide"
description: "Basic integration steps for payment systems"
audience: "Developers"
tags: ["payments"]
# Payment Integration Guide
## Overview
This guide helps integrate payment systems with your platform.
## Steps
1. Get API keys from your provider
2. Make API calls to process payments
3. Handle webhooks for payment confirmation
## Notes
- Use HTTPS
- Store secrets securely
---
## Why it fails
Lacks specificity about vendors, implementation details, and enterprise requirements. No concrete examples or technical depth for platform partners.
## Anti-Example 2: API Reference Contamination

# Stripe Integration Guide
## API Endpoints
- POST /v1/charges (Create charge)
- GET /v1/customers (List customers)
## Parameters
- amount (integer, required)
- currency (string, 3-letter ISO code)
- description (string, max 255 chars)
## Example
```json
{
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "usd",
  "description": "Monthly subscription"
}

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
