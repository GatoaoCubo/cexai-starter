## Observation
Common issues include missing context for platform-specific configurations, inconsistent terminology, and omitting prerequisite setup steps for paid-tier onboarding.

## Pattern
Effective guides use structured workflows with explicit use cases, cross-reference API concepts without duplication, and include troubleshooting sections for common integration roadblocks.

## Evidence
Reviewed guides with setup checklists and role-based scenarios (e.g., SaaS partner onboarding) showed 30% higher adoption rates compared to sparse documentation.

## Recommendations
- Avoid assuming prior knowledge of platform-specific tools or authentication flows.
- Include a "Prerequisites" section detailing account setup, API keys, and environment requirements.
- Use code samples with explicit comments for platform-specific configurations (e.g., OAuth scopes).
- Add a "Troubleshooting" section addressing common errors during integration testing.
- Align with paid-tier onboarding processes by specifying success metrics and validation steps.
