## Architectural Position
rbac_policy sits at the core of CEX pillar P09, orchestrating role-based access control by translating stakeholder requirements (via bld_instruction, bld_collaboration) into enforceable policies through schema validation (bld_schema), quality checks (bld_quality_gate), and integration with external enforcement tools (policy_engine). It ensures alignment with P09's governance objectives by maintaining traceability across policy lifecycle stages.
