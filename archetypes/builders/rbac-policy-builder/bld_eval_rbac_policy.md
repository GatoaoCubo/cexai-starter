## Examples

## Golden Example
```yaml
kind: rbac_policy
name: multi_tenant_rbac
spec:
  tenants:
    - name: "acme_corp"
      roles:
        - name: "database_admin"
          permissions:
            - "read:acme_corp/databases/*"
            - "write:acme_corp/databases/*"
        - name: "developer"
          permissions:
            - "read:acme_corp/databases/*"
    - name: "initech_inc"
      roles:
        - name: "data_viewer"
          permissions:
            - "read:initech_inc/datasets/*"
```

## Anti-Example 1: Global Permissions
```yaml
kind: rbac_policy
name: bad_global_rbac
spec:
  tenants:
    - name: "all_tenants"
      roles:
        - name: "super_admin"
          permissions:
            - "read:*/*"
            - "write:*/*"
```
## Why it fails
Lacks tenant isolation by using a wildcard (`*/*`) permission scope, allowing a single role to access resources across all tenants. Violates multi-tenant security principles by eliminating boundary enforcement.

## Anti-Example 2: Role Overlap
```yaml
kind: rbac_policy
name: overlapping_roles
spec:
  tenants:
    - name: "cloudnine"
      roles:
        - name: "analyst"
          permissions:
            - "read:cloudnine/reports/*"
            - "write:cloudnine/reports/*"
        - name: "manager"
          permissions:
            - "read:cloudnine/reports/*"
            - "write:cloudnine/reports/*"
```
## Why it fails
Duplicates permissions between roles (`analyst` and `manager`) without differentiation. Creates ambiguity in access control and increases risk of accidental over-privilege due to redundant role definitions.

### H_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (HARD)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (min 3 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream or sibling reference
- Gate: REJECT if < 3 entries (auto-populated by cex_wikilink.py at F6.5)

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
