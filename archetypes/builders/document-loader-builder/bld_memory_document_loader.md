## Summary
Chunk strategy and metadata preservation are the two highest-leverage decisions in
document_loader design. A loader with wrong chunk_strategy or missing source metadata
degrades every downstream retrieval query — the damage is invisible at ingestion time
but catastrophic at query time.

## Pattern
**Semantic chunking + overlap + full metadata = RAG baseline**
- semantic > recursive > sentence > fixed for retrieval recall on open-domain QA
- recursive is safe default when semantic chunking infeasible (no embedding budget)
- overlap of 12.5% of chunk_size is minimum; 20% for highly dense technical text
- metadata must include: source, chunk_index, total_chunks, format, page (if paged format)

## Anti-Pattern
| Mistake | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| overlap: 0 | Answers that span chunk boundaries never retrieved | Set overlap >= chunk_size * 0.125 |
| Missing source metadata | Citation impossible; retrieval results unverifiable | Always include source field |
| Ignoring encoding | Silent UnicodeDecodeError on ~8% of real-world corpora | Use chardet before open() |
| Single parser for all formats | HTML chunks contain nav/footer boilerplate; CSV as raw text | Per-format parser + post-processing step |
| chunk_size > 1024 tokens | Exceeds context window of smaller LLMs; dilutes retrieval score | Default 512; max 1024 for GPT-4 class |
| No corrupt file handling | Silent data loss — documents missing from index with no log | Try/except per file, emit partial doc + error_metadata |

## Context
- 2048 byte body budget: forces concise spec — use tables, not prose
- Retriever downstream: chunk quality directly determines retriever precision@k
- Embedding cost: smaller chunks = more embeddings = higher cost; balance with recall
- Unstructured.io auto-detects format for mixed-format corpora; single-format loaders
  should use format-specific parsers for higher fidelity
- Apache Tika covers 1000+ formats via JVM; use for rare formats before building costm parser

## Versioning Signals
- Bump minor version when adding new formats_supported
- Bump patch version when updating chunk_size or overlap defaults
- Bump major version when changing chunk_strategy or output_format (breaking change for downstream)
