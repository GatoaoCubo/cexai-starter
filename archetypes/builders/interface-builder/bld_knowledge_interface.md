# Domain Knowledge: interface
## Executive Summary
Interfaces are bilateral contracts where both provider and consumer agree on methods, input shapes, and output shapes. Rooted in interface-based programming (GoF 1994) and API-first design. Interfaces define what CAN happen between two systems — they are static specifications, not runtime events. They differ from input schemas (unilateral), signals (runtime notifications), and connectors (runtime implementations).
## Spec Table
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Pillar | P06 (contracts/schema) |
| Frontmatter fields | 20+ |
| Quality gates | 8 HARD + 10 SOFT |
| Direction | Bilateral (both parties agree) |
| Key sections | methods (name, input, output), versioning, deprecation |
| Versioning | semver with backward_compatible flag |
| Mock support | Test doubles derivable from interface |
## Patterns
- **Method-based contracts**: named operations with typed input and output
| Source | Concept | Application |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| OpenAPI 3.x | REST paths, schemas, responses | methods structure |
| gRPC/Protobuf | Typed RPC method definitions | Strongly typed method contracts |
| TypeScript | Structural type contracts | Bilateral type agreement |
| GraphQL | Query/mutation typed fields | Method-level I/O contracts |
| Java interfaces | Abstract method signatures | Method signature pattern |
- **Bilateral agreement**: both provider and consumer acknowledge the contract — unlike unilateral input schemas
- **Versioning with semver**: breaking changes require major version bump; backward_compatible flag explicit
- **Deprecation planning**: every method has planned sunset timeline — no sudden removal
- **Mock derivation**: interfaces generate test doubles automatically — testing does not require real implementation
- **Static specification**: interfaces define what CAN happen, not what DID happen (that is a signal)
## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why it fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| Unilateral contract | That is an input_schema; interfaces require both parties |
| No versioning | Breaking changes break consumers silently |
| No deprecation timeline | Methods removed without warning; consumer breakage |
| Free-text I/O types | Cannot generate mocks or validate compliance |
| Runtime state in interface | Interfaces are static specs; use signals for events |
| No mock specification | Cannot test without real implementation |
## Application
1. Identify parties: who is provider, who is consumer?
2. Define methods: name, typed input, typed output per operation
3. Set version: semver with backward_compatible flag
4. Plan deprecation: sunset timeline for methods to be removed
5. Add mock spec: example inputs and outputs for test doubles
6. Validate: bilateral agreement, all methods typed, version declared
