# Collaboration: interface-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "what is the formal contract between these two agents/systems?"
I do not define unilateral input schemas. I do not build runtime signals.
I specify bilateral integration contracts so agents and systems interoperate reliably.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Integration Design"
```
  1. component-map-builder -> "inventory of components that need interfaces"
  2. interface-builder -> "bilateral contracts between components"
  3. client-builder -> "client implementations against interfaces"
  4. connector-builder -> "bidirectional integrations via interfaces"
```
### Crew: "Contract Stack"
```
  1. input-schema-builder -> "unilateral input contracts"
  2. interface-builder -> "bilateral integration contracts"
  3. e2e-eval-builder -> "validation that contracts are honored"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: party A name, party B name, methods/operations list
- optional: versioning strategy, deprecation policy, mock specifications
### I Produce
- interface artifact (.md + .yaml frontmatter)
- committed to: `cex/P06/examples/p06_interface_{a}_{b}.md`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons
## Builders I Depend On
- input-schema-builder: provides unilateral schemas that compose into bilateral contracts
- component-map-builder: identifies which components need interfaces
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| client-builder | Implements outbound side of the interface |
| connector-builder | Implements bidirectional side of the interface |
| e2e-eval-builder | Tests that interface contracts are honored end-to-end |
| dispatch-rule-builder | Routes to targets defined by interface contracts |
