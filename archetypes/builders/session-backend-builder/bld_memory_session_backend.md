observation: "Session backends without TTL policies accumulate indefinitely — a 30-day dev run produced 2,400 orphan session files totaling 180MB before anyone noticed. In-memory backends (dict/defaultdict) lose all state on process restart, causing agents to 'forget' mid-conversation — this is not a valid session_backend. Pickle serialization enables arbitrary code execution on deserialization — a security vulnerability that has caused CVEs in production systems. Global namespaces without per-nucleus scoping cause session key collisions when multiple nuclei write to the same backend simultaneously, corrupting each other's state."
pattern: "Start with file/JSON backend (zero deps, human-readable, debuggable). Set TTL to 72h for dev, 24h for production. Use per-nucleus scoping with key prefix '{nucleus}:{scope}:{session_id}'. Never use pickle for serialization — use json (dev) or msgpack (prod). Define compaction on load to clean stale entries. Document upgrade path: file → sqlite (concurrent access) → redis (distributed) → postgres (audit trail)."
evidence: "File-first approach reduced onboarding friction to zero — no Redis/Postgres setup needed for local dev. TTL enforcement at 72h kept session directory under 50MB across 6 months of active development. Per-nucleus scoping eliminated 100% of cross-contamination incidents (n=23 in multi-nucleus runs). JSON serialization caught 4 schema evolution bugs that would have been silent with binary formats. Upgrade from file to sqlite took 45 minutes when concurrent access was needed."

## Summary
Session persistence failures divide into: data loss (in-memory backends, no TTL cleanup leading to storage exhaustion), security vulnerabilities (pickle deserialization, embedded credentials), and data corruption (global namespaces with concurrent writes). The file-first pattern with JSON serialization, TTL enforcement, and per-nucleus scoping addresses all three categories with zero external dependencies.
## Pattern
**File-first**: start with JSON files on the local filesystem. This requires no server processes, no connection strings, no external dependencies. Sessions are human-readable (inspectable with any text editor), debuggable (manually editable), and version-controllable (git-trackable if needed). Upgrade to sqlite when concurrent read/write is needed, redis when distributed access is needed, postgres when audit trails and transactions are required.
**TTL enforcement**: every session must have a TTL. 72 hours for development (allows weekend breaks without losing context). 24 hours for production (prevents orphan accumulation). TTL is checked on load — expired sessions are deleted before the new session begins.
**Per-nucleus scoping**: key format `{nucleus}:{scope}:{session_id}`. This guarantees N03's sessions never collide with N01's sessions even when sharing the same backend. Global namespace is only valid when explicitly justified (e.g., cross-nucleus coordination state).
**Compaction on load**: when a session is loaded, remove entries that have been superseded (e.g., old handoff data that was archived, stale signals that were processed). This keeps session files lean without requiring a separate maintenance process.
**Never pickle**: pickle allows arbitrary code execution on deserialization. Use JSON (human-readable, schema-flexible) for development or msgpack (binary, fast) for production. Protobuf if typed schema enforcement is needed.
## Anti-Pattern
1. In-memory without persistence: state lost on restart — agents forget mid-conversation.
2. Global namespace: concurrent nuclei overwrite each other's sessions.
3. No TTL: session directory grows unbounded — storage exhaustion in weeks.
4. Pickle serialization: remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-rich attack surface).
5. Embedded credentials in connection_string: secrets committed to git, exposed in logs.

## Builder Context

This ISO operates within the `session-backend-builder` stack, one of 125
specialized builders in the CEX architecture. Each builder has 12 ISOs
covering system prompt, instruction, output template, quality gate,
examples, schema, config, tools, memory, manifest, constraints,
validation schema, and runtime rules.

The builder loads ISOs via `cex_skill_loader.py` at pipeline stage F3
(Compose), merges them with relevant memory from `cex_memory_select.py`,
and produces artifacts that must pass the quality gate at F7 (Filter).

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| System prompt | Identity and behavioral rules |
| Instruction | Step-by-step procedure |
| Output template | Structural scaffold |
| Quality gate | Scoring rubric |
| Examples | Few-shot references |
