## Domain Overview
The healthcare industry vertical centers on managing sensitive patient data, ensuring interoperability through standardized protocols, and adhering to regulatory frameworks like HIPAA. Key challenges include secure handling of Protected Health Information (PHI), seamless data exchange between systems (e.g., EHRs, labs), and compliance with evolving standards such as HL7/FHIR. Use cases span clinical workflows, telemedicine, and population health management, requiring robust data governance and encryption practices.

Healthcare IT systems must balance innovation with strict privacy controls, often integrating legacy systems with modern APIs. Standards like HL7’s FHIR enable structured data sharing, while HIPAA mandates safeguards for PHI across storage, transmission, and access. The vertical’s complexity demands collaboration between clinicians, IT, and compliance teams to avoid breaches and ensure seamless care delivery.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Definition | Source |
|---|---|---|
| PHI | Individually identifiable health information protected under HIPAA | HIPAA Title II (45 CFR 160) |
| FHIR R4 | HL7’s standards-based API for exchanging healthcare data using RESTful methods | HL7 FHIR R4 (2021) |
| HL7 v2.x | Legacy messaging standard for clinical data exchange (e.g., ADT, ORU) | HL7 v2.8 (2020) |
| IHE Profiles | Frameworks for integrating healthcare IT systems via defined use cases | IHE Technical Framework (2023) |
| DICOM | Standard for medical imaging data storage, transmission, and compression | DICOM 2023a |
| ICD-10 / SNOMED-CT / LOINC | Disease classification, clinical terminology, and lab observation coding | WHO / SNOMED / Regenstrief |
| HIPAA Security Rule | Requirements for safeguarding ePHI (encryption, access controls, audit logs) | 45 CFR 164.300-318 |
| BAA | Business Associate Agreement -- required when a vendor processes PHI on behalf of a covered entity | 45 CFR 164.504(e) |
| Safe Harbor de-identification | Method removing 18 specific PHI identifiers to render data non-identifiable | 45 CFR 164.514(b)(2) |
| 21 CFR Part 11 | FDA regulation for electronic records and electronic signatures in clinical trials | FDA 21 CFR Part 11 |
| HITRUST CSF | Certifiable framework combining HIPAA, NIST, ISO 27001 for healthcare security | HITRUST Alliance v11 |

## Industry Standards
- HIPAA Privacy Rule + Security Rule (45 CFR 160/164)
- HL7 FHIR R4 / R5
- IHE Technical Framework
- DICOM 2023a
- ICD-10-CM / SNOMED-CT / LOINC
- 21 CFR Part 11 (FDA electronic records)
- HITRUST CSF v11
- HIPAA Omnibus Rule (2013)
- NIST SP 800-66 (HIPAA Security Rule implementation guide)

## Common Patterns
1. Use FHIR APIs for interoperable EHR data exchange.
2. Implement AES-256 encryption for PHI at rest and in transit.
3. Employ HL7 v2.x messaging for legacy hospital system integration.
4. Apply IHE profiles to standardize imaging and lab workflow integration.
5. Map ICD-10 codes to SNOMED-CT for clinical decision support.

## Pitfalls
- Mishandling PHI without HIPAA-compliant access controls (RBAC + MFA).
- Using unencrypted channels for transmitting ePHI (violates HIPAA Security Rule 45 CFR 164.312).
- Relying on outdated HL7 v2.x without FHIR R4 migration path for new integrations.
- Failing to validate FHIR resources against conformance statements and profiles.
- Missing BAA with cloud vendors and SaaS platforms that process PHI.
- Applying Expert Determination de-identification without qualified statistician sign-off; use Safe Harbor (18 identifiers) for simpler compliance.
- Ignoring 21 CFR Part 11 requirements when building clinical trial data systems (e-signatures, audit trails).
- Pursuing HITRUST CSF certification without gap analysis against HIPAA + ISO 27001 first.
- Overlooking LOINC codes for lab results interoperability alongside SNOMED-CT for diagnoses.
