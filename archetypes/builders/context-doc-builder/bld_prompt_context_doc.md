# Instructions: How to Produce a context_doc
## Phase 1: RESEARCH
1. Identify the domain to document (snake_case label, e.g., `ecommerce_imports`, `api_auth_jwt`)
2. Define scope boundaries: write one sentence — "This context covers [X] within [Y] for [Z] audience"
3. List what is explicitly out of scope (minimum 1-3 items)
4. Catalog stakeholders and their needs: who consumes this document and for what purpose (agent, human, or both)
5. Identify constraints: technical, business, or regulatory rules that cannot change
6. List assumptions: what is taken as given without requiring proof
7. Identify dependencies on other domains, services, or artifacts
8. Check existing context_docs for overlapping scope to avoid duplication
## Phase 2: COMPOSE
1. Read SCHEMA.md — source of truth for all fields
2. Read OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md — fill `{{vars}}` following SCHEMA constraints
3. Fill frontmatter: all required fields, id as `p01_cd_{{topic_slug}}` (quality: null — never self-score)
4. Write Domain Scope section: restate scope sentence, list included and excluded topics explicitly
5. Write Stakeholders section: who uses this context and why, one entry per stakeholder type
6. Write Constraints section: technical, business, and regulatory constraints that bound the domain
7. Write Assumptions section: working assumptions taken as given, one per line
8. Write Dependencies section: other domains, services, and artifacts this document references
9. Write Key Concepts section: 3-5 essential ideas required to understand this domain
10. Verify body <= 2048 bytes; if over limit, trim Key Concepts first, then Dependencies
## Phase 3: VALIDATE
1. Check QUALITY_GATES.md — verify each HARD gate manually
2. Confirm YAML frontmatter parses without errors
3. Confirm id matches `p01_cd_`
4. Confirm kind == context_doc
5. Confirm scope boundary is defined (Domain Scope section present and at least 3 lines)
6. Confirm at least 1 stakeholder is listed
7. Confirm constraints are listed (not empty)
8. Confirm body <= 2048 bytes
9. HARD gates: frontmatter valid, id pattern matches, scope defined, stakeholder present, constraints listed
10. SOFT gates: score against QUALITY_GATES.md
11. Cross-check: domain context for hydration (not an atomic fact = knowledge_card)? Not a single-term definition (glossary_entry)? Not step-by-step procedural guidance (instruction)?
12. Revise if score < 8.0 before outputting
