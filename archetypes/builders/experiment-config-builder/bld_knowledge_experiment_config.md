# Domain Knowledge: experiment_config
## Executive Summary
Experiment configs define the complete specification for a controlled trial (A/B test) --
variant parameters, traffic allocation, success metrics, statistical thresholds, and lifecycle
state. Following the controlled experiment paradigm, one variant is always the control
(unchanged baseline); all others are treatments. The experiment concludes when it reaches
statistical significance AND minimum runtime. Experiment configs are temporary by definition;
promoted winners become feature_flag (permanent toggle) or env_config (new variable).

## Spec Table
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Pillar | P09 (config) |
| llm_function | GOVERN |
| Frontmatter fields | 18+ |
| Quality gates | 10 HARD + 12 SOFT |
| Traffic split | Must sum to 100; equal split preferred |
| Variant structure | control (baseline) + 1+ treatments |
| Statistical default | alpha=0.05, 80pct power |

## Patterns
### Variant Type System
| Type | Role | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| control | Baseline; no changes | Always first in variants list |
| treatment | Modified version being tested | Describe exactly what changed |

### Metric Taxonomy
| Category | Role | Examples |
|----------|------|---------|
| primary | Single KPI determining winner | task_completion_rate, response_quality_score |
| guardrail | Must not regress; pauses experiment if breached | p99_latency_ms, error_rate, cost_per_request |
| secondary | Context only; not decision-making | session_length, retry_count |

### Statistical Parameters
| Parameter | Formula/Default | When |
|-----------|----------------|------|
| significance_threshold | alpha=0.05 (default) | Pre-register before launch |
| min_detectable_effect | business-driven minimum | Pre-register before launch |
| sample_size_target | n = f(alpha, power, MDE, baseline) | Calculate before launch |
| duration_days | max(7, time_to_reach_sample_target) | Minimum 7 days for novelty effect |

### Experiment Lifecycle
| Status | Meaning | Next action |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| draft | Spec complete; not yet launched | Validate and launch |
| running | Traffic flowing; collecting data | Monitor guardrails daily |
| paused | Guardrail breach or operational issue | Investigate and resume or abort |
| concluded | Decision made; winner documented | Promote winner or document learnings |

## Prompt Experiment Specifics
LLM prompt A/B tests have unique considerations vs UI experiments:
- Variance is higher: LLM outputs are stochastic; same prompt produces different outputs
- Evaluation is harder: primary metrics often require human or LLM-as-judge scoring
- Novelty effect: users behave differently with new phrasing before adapting (min 7 days)
- Cost guardrail: treatments with longer prompts may cost more per request

Common primary metrics for prompt experiments:
| Metric | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| task_completion_rate | binary | Did the user get what they needed? |
| response_quality_score | 1-5 scale | LLM-as-judge or human evaluation |
| user_satisfaction | thumbs up/down | Direct feedback signal |
| review_acceptance_rate | binary | User accepted/applied the suggestion |

## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why it fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| No pre-registered primary metric | Enables p-hacking (choosing winning metric post-hoc) |
| Concluding before minimum runtime | Novelty effect inflates early treatment performance |
| Traffic split not summing to 100 | Undefined traffic allocation; routing bugs |
| No guardrail metrics | Wins primary while degrading latency or error rate |
| Multiple primary metrics | Creates winner selection ambiguity; invalidates stats |
| Underpowered experiment | Small real effects missed; ship null results as "no winner" |

## Application
1. Write falsifiable hypothesis before designing variants
2. Define primary_metric and guardrail_metrics before launch
3. Calculate sample_size_target from MDE + significance threshold
4. Set duration_days >= 7; cap at reasonable maximum (e.g., 28 days)
5. Verify traffic_split sums to 100; use equal splits unless justified
6. Monitor guardrails daily during running status
7. Conclude only after: p < significance_threshold AND runtime >= min(7 days, duration_days)
8. Document winning_variant and learnings; update lifecycle to concluded
