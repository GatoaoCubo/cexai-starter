## Component Inventory
| Name | Role | Owner | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| variants | List of all variants: control (baseline) + 1+ treatments | experiment-config-builder | required |
| traffic_split | Allocation per variant as integer percentages summing to 100 | experiment-config-builder | required |
| hypothesis | Falsifiable statement: if X then Y measured by Z | experiment-config-builder | required |
| primary_metric | Single KPI that determines the winning variant | experiment-config-builder | required |
| guardrail_metrics | Metrics that must not regress; breach pauses experiment | experiment-config-builder | required |
| statistical_parameters | significance_threshold, MDE, sample_size_target, duration_days | experiment-config-builder | required |
| lifecycle | Status (draft/running/paused/concluded), dates, decision criteria | experiment-config-builder | required |
| segment | Audience scope: all, power_users, new_users, custom | experiment-config-builder | optional |
| winning_variant | Populated on conclusion; references winning variant name | experiment-config-builder | optional |
| metadata | id, version, pillar, author, created, updated | experiment-config-builder | required |

## Dependency Graph
```
quality_gate (P11) --governs--> experiment_config (scoring rubric for experiment validity)
experiment_config --produces--> feature_flag (P09) (winning variant promoted to permanent toggle)
experiment_config --reads--> env_config (P09) (experiment may vary env variables between variants)
experiment_config --consumed_by--> prompt_template (P03) (variant prompt templates injected per traffic group)
experiment_config --consumed_by--> agent (P02) (agent reads experiment config to select active variant)
experiment_config --consumed_by--> trace_config (P09) (observability traces tagged with experiment_id + variant)
learning_record (P10) --receives_from--> experiment_config (concluded experiments feed learnings to memory)
```

| From | To | Type | Data |
|------|----|------|------|
| quality_gate | experiment_config | governs | scoring criteria for experiment validity |
| experiment_config | feature_flag | produces | concluded winning variant promoted to permanent |
| experiment_config | env_config | reads | variant-specific environment variables |
| experiment_config | prompt_template | consumed_by | variant prompts selected by traffic group |
| experiment_config | agent | consumed_by | active variant parameters per request |
| experiment_config | trace_config | consumed_by | experiment_id and variant tag injected in traces |
| experiment_config | learning_record | produces | findings, effect size, decision rationale |

## Boundary Table
| experiment_config IS | experiment_config IS NOT |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| A temporary controlled trial comparing variants against a control | A feature_flag (P09) -- feature_flag is a permanent on/off toggle with rollout logic |
| Defines traffic allocation, success metrics, and statistical thresholds | An env_config (P09) -- env_config catalogs deployment variables without variants |
| Lifecycle-bounded: concludes when reaching significance + min runtime | A quality_gate (P11) -- quality_gate is a scoring rubric, not an experiment design |
| Produces a winner that may graduate to feature_flag or env change | A prompt_template (P03) -- prompt_template is the variant content, not the experiment spec |
| Governs statistical decisions (significance, MDE, sample size) | A runtime_rule (P09) -- runtime_rule governs behavioral limits like timeouts/retries |

## Layer Map
| Layer | Components | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Definition | hypothesis, variants, traffic_split | What is being tested and how traffic flows |
| Measurement | primary_metric, guardrail_metrics | What success and failure look like |
| Statistics | significance_threshold, MDE, sample_size_target | When to conclude |
| Lifecycle | status, duration_days, winning_variant | Temporal state management |
| Safety | guardrail_metrics, quality_gate | Prevent degradation while optimizing |
