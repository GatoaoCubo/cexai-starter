# Rules: lineage_record Builder

## Hard Constraints
1. At least 1 source entity MUST be listed
2. At least 1 activity MUST be listed
3. At least 1 agent MUST be listed
4. sources_count MUST equal len(entities list)
5. activities_count MUST equal len(activities list)
6. quality MUST be null
7. id pattern: `^p01_lin_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$`

## Edge Cases
| Situation | Resolution |
|-----------|-----------|
| Provenance unknown | Use entity type: unknown; note "provenance not available" |
| Multiple derivation relations | List all in Derivation Relations section |
| Artifact revised from prior version | Use wasRevisionOf derivation type |
| Tool (not nucleus) as agent | agent type: tool; include tool id |
| Human curator as agent | agent type: human; include name/role |
| Circular derivation detected | Flag as data integrity issue; escalate to N04 |
| User confuses with audit_log | Redirect: create audit_log for compliance events |
