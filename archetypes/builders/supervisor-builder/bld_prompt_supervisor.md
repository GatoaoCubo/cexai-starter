# Instructions: How to Produce a supervisor
## Phase 1: RESEARCH
1. Identify the mission or goal this supervisor coordinates — what outcome do the builders collectively produce?
2. List all builders required: name each builder, its nucleus, and what it contributes to the mission
3. Map dependencies: which builders must complete before others can start?
4. Determine dispatch_mode: sequential (safe, ordered), parallel (fast, independent), or conditional (route by task content)
5. Define signal protocol: what signal files does each builder emit on completion?
6. Identify fallback behavior per builder: retry, skip, substitute, or abort-mission
7. Search for existing directors in the same domain to avoid duplicate orchestration definitions
## Phase 2: COMPOSE
1. Read SCHEMA.md — source of truth for all fields
2. Read OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md — template to fill
3. Fill frontmatter: topic, builders (list), dispatch_mode, signal_check, quality: null
4. Set llm_function: ORCHESTRATE (always for directors, never override)
5. Write Identity section: 2-4 sentences on orchestration scope, domain, and coordination strategy
6. Write Builders section: list each builder with role and nucleus assignment
7. Write Wave Topology section: waves in sequence, builders per wave, signal gates between waves
8. Write Dispatch Config section: mode, timeout, fallback_per_builder
9. Write Routing section: keywords and triggers that activate this supervisor
10. Write Crew Role section: the coordination question this supervisor answers, and explicit exclusions
11. Check body <= 2048 bytes
## Phase 3: VALIDATE
1. Check QUALITY_GATES.md manually
2. HARD gate: id matches `ex_director_` pattern
3. HARD gate: kind == supervisor
4. HARD gate: quality == null
5. HARD gate: builders list has >= 2 entries (a supervisor with 1 builder is pointless)
6. HARD gate: dispatch_mode is one of: sequential, parallel, conditional
7. HARD gate: llm_function == ORCHESTRATE
8. HARD gate: signal_check field is set (not blank)
9. Cross-check: does the supervisor contain ANY task execution logic? If yes, remove it — directors dispatch, not execute
10. Cross-check: is wave topology consistent with dispatch_mode? (parallel mode should not have wave dependencies)
11. Cross-check: does every builder in the list have a fallback defined?
12. If score < 8.0: revise before outputting
