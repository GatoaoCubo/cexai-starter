# Config: supervisor Production Rules
## Naming Convention
| Scope | Convention | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Artifact files | `ex_director_{topic}.md` + `.yaml` | `ex_director_brand_launch.md` |
| Builder directory | kebab-case | `supervisor-builder/` |
| Frontmatter fields | snake_case | `dispatch_mode`, `signal_check` |
| Topic slug | snake_case, lowercase | `brand_launch`, `content_pipeline` |
Rule: id MUST equal filename stem.
## File Paths
- Output (canonical): `P08_architecture/examples/ex_director_{topic}.md`
- Compiled: `P08_architecture/compiled/ex_director_{topic}.yaml`
## Size Limits (aligned with SCHEMA)
- Body: max 2048 bytes
- Total (frontmatter + body): ~3200 bytes
- Density: >= 0.85
## Dispatch Mode Enum
| Value | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| sequential | Builders have strict ordering dependencies |
| parallel | Builders are independent — run simultaneously |
| conditional | Route to specific builders based on task content or signals |
## Wave Topology Rules
- Wave N+1 starts ONLY after all Wave N signals received (when signal_check: true)
- Each wave lists its builders by name and nucleus
- Fallback per builder: retry (1x), skip, substitute (name alternate), abort
## Body Requirements
- Identity: 2-4 sentences naming the mission, domain, and coordination strategy
- Builders: table or list of all dispatched builders with role and nucleus
- Wave Topology: ordered wave sequence with signal gates
- Dispatch Config: mode + signal_check + fallback_per_builder
- Routing: triggers + keywords + NOT-when exclusions (mandatory)
