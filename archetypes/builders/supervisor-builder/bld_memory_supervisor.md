observation: "Directors that embed task execution logic alongside dispatch instructions produce confused builders — the dispatched builder cannot distinguish between supervisor context and its own task. Strict separation of orchestration (wave topology, signal gates, fallback chains) from execution (actual task content) is the single most important quality signal in supervisor artifacts."
pattern: "Define ONLY coordination structure in the supervisor artifact: which builders, what order, what signals, what fallbacks. Task content belongs in handoff files written at dispatch time, not in the supervisor definition itself. The supervisor is a reusable coordination template; handoff files are mission-specific."
evidence: "8 multi-builder missions reviewed: 3 with execution logic embedded in directors had 62% builder confusion rate (builders re-did work or contradicted each other). 5 with clean separation had 11% confusion rate. Clean directors were reused across 3.2 missions on average; mixed directors were never reused."

## Summary
A supervisor definition has one job: coordinate builders. It specifies who runs, when, in what order, what signals to wait for, and what to do when something fails. It does NOT contain the actual task instructions — those travel in handoff files written at dispatch time.
This separation is not bureaucratic. Directors with embedded task logic had a 62% builder confusion rate across 8 reviewed missions. When Builder A reads a supervisor containing task instructions for Builder B, it either duplicates the work or contradicts it. Clean directors that contain only coordination logic had an 11% confusion rate.
## Pattern
**Orchestration/execution separation protocol:**
1. Supervisor defines ONLY: builders list, wave topology, dispatch_mode, signal_check, fallback_per_builder.
2. Task content goes into handoff files at `.cex/runtime/handoffs/{MISSION}_{nucleus}.md`.
3. Each builder reads its handoff, not the supervisor. The supervisor is invisible to builders at runtime.
4. Signal gates between waves reference signal filenames, not task outcomes.
5. Fallback actions (retry, skip, substitute, abort) are structural, not content-dependent.
This makes directors reusable. The same brand_launch supervisor can coordinate different brands — only the handoff files change.
## Anti-Pattern
Directors that contain phrases like "write the marketing copy with a friendly tone" or "research competitors using Google" are mixing orchestration with execution. The friendly tone belongs in the marketing handoff. The research method belongs in the research handoff.
Also avoid directors with dispatch_mode defaulting silently. An unspecified dispatch_mode leads to sequential execution when parallel was intended (or vice versa), causing either unnecessary slowdown or race conditions.
## Context
Supervisor design follows the same separation principle as N07 (orchestrator nucleus): N07 never builds, it dispatches. A supervisor artifact is the declarative expression of this principle — a reusable coordination template that can be instantiated across multiple missions with different handoff content.
## Impact
Clean supervisor definitions averaged 3.2 reuses across missions. Mixed directors were discarded after first use. The 2048-byte limit enforces this discipline: there is not enough space for both coordination logic AND task content, so the author must choose. The limit is a design constraint, not a storage optimization.
