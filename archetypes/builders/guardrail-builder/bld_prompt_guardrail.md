# Instructions: How to Produce a guardrail
## Phase 1: RESEARCH
1. Identify the threat or risk to guard against — what harm, misuse, or failure mode does this guardrail prevent?
2. Classify severity: critical (system-breaking or data-destroying), high (significant operational impact), medium (quality degradation), low (minor policy deviation)
3. Determine enforcement mode: block (reject the operation), warn (proceed with logged alert), log (silent audit trail)
4. Define scope of application — which agents, pipelines, operations, or domains does this guardrail cover?
5. Catalog violation examples — collect at least 2 concrete inputs or actions that would trigger this guardrail
6. Check existing guardrails for coverage gaps — avoid duplicating a guardrail that already covers this threat
## Phase 2: COMPOSE
1. Read SCHEMA.md — source of truth for all required fields
2. Read OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md — fill following SCHEMA constraints
3. Fill frontmatter: all required fields, quality: null (never self-score), severity and enforcement set from research
4. Write Threat section: what risk this guardrail addresses and why it matters in this domain
5. Write Rules section: specific restrictions as declarative statements — each rule must be concrete and independently enforceable
6. Write Severity section: classification (critical/high/medium/low) with one-paragraph justification
7. Write Enforcement section: enforcement mode (block/warn/log) and the implementation mechanism that detects violations
8. Write Violations section: at least 2 concrete examples of inputs or actions that trigger this guardrail
9. Write Bypass Policy section: under what conditions this can be overridden (if ever), who must approve, and what audit trail is required
## Phase 3: VALIDATE
1. Check QUALITY_GATES.md — run all HARD gates manually
2. HARD gates:
   - [ ] id matches `p11_gr_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+`
   - [ ] kind == `guardrail`
   - [ ] quality == null
   - [ ] severity is one of: critical, high, medium, low
   - [ ] enforcement mode is one of: block, warn, log
   - [ ] at least 2 violation examples present
3. SOFT gates: rules are concrete not aspirational, bypass policy defined, scope of application specified
4. Cross-check: safety boundary not access control (that is permission)? Not an operational law? Not quality scoring (that is quality_gate)? Every rule enforceable without subjective judgment?
5. If score < 8.0: revise in the same pass before outputting
