## Context

This ISO operationalizes a mental model -- a compact analogy or abstraction that guides reasoning.
The mental-model-builder produces `mental_model` artifacts (P02) — design-time cognitive maps that define how an agent routes tasks, makes decisions, and prioritizes work. Mental models differ from agent definitions (identity and capabilities), runtime state (P10, ephemeral), and router artifacts (pure task dispatchers): a mental model encodes the thinking patterns an agent uses during execution.
**Inputs:**
- `$agent_name (required) - string - "The agent this mental model belongs to (e.g. 'scout-agent', 'invariant-builder')"`
- `$agent_slug (required) - string - "snake_case version of agent name for use in id field"`
- `$domain (required) - string - "Primary domain the agent operates in"`
- `$routing_triggers (required) - list[string] - "Keywords or signal types that trigger this agent's activation"`
- `$decisions (optional) - list[string] - "Key binary or multi-path decisions the agent makes during operation"`
- `$domain_map (optional) - object - "What the agent covers vs what it delegates; keys: covers, routes_to"`
**Output:** A single `mental_model` artifact (P02), body <= 2048 bytes, with 14 required + 9 recommended frontmatter fields and body sections covering agent reference, routing rules, decision tree, priorities, heuristics, domain map, and fallback.
**Boundary check before proceeding:**
- Need to define the agent's identity and capabilities → route to agent-builder
- Need to define runtime state → do not use mental_model (P02), use P10 runtime state
- Need a pure task dispatcher with no domain logic → route to router-builder (planned)
- Need to encode how an agent thinks, routes, and decides → proceed
## Phases
### Phase 1: Analyze
**Action:** Gather and organize the cognitive parameters of the target agent.
1. Identify the **target agent** by name and domain.
2. Determine primary **routing patterns**: what input signals trigger what agent behaviors.
3. List **key decisions** the agent makes — binary or multi-path choices at decision points.
4. Identify **priority ordering**: what takes precedence when multiple tasks or signals compete.
5. Collect **heuristics**: actionable rules of thumb derived from the agent's operational patterns.
6. Map **domain boundaries**:
   - `covers`: what this agent handles directly
   - `routes_to`: what this agent delegates, and to which other agents
7. Check for existing mental_models for the same agent — avoid duplicates.
8. Confirm this is P02 (design-time cognitive map), NOT P10 (runtime state).
9. Define `fallback`: what the agent does when no routing rule matches.
**Verification:** You can describe the agent's routing in one sentence: "When [signal type], this agent does [action]; when [other signal], it routes to [other agent]."
### Phase 2: Compose
**Action:** Write all frontmatter fields and body sections within the 2048-byte body limit.
1. Read `SCHEMA.md` — source of truth for all 14 required + 9 recommended fields.
2. Read `OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md` — fill every `{{var}}` following SCHEMA constraints.
3. Generate `agent_slug` in snake_case from the agent name.
4. Fill frontmatter: all 14 required fields (`quality: null`).
5. Build `routing_rules`: list of >= 3 rules, each with: `keywords` (list), `action` (string), `confidence` (float 0.0–1.0).
6. Build `decision_tree`: list of >= 2 conditions, each with: `condition` (string), `then` (string), `else` (string).
7. Set `priorities`: ordered list, highest priority first.
8. Set `heuristics`: list of actionable rules of thumb (not observations — each must guide a choice).
9. Set `domain_map`: object with `covers` (list) and `routes_to` (dict: domain → agent).
10. Set `personality`: object with `tone`, `verbosity`, `risk_tolerance`.
11. Set `constraints`: list of hard behavioral limits the agent must never violate.
12. Set `fallback`: object with `action` (what to do) and `escalate_to` (who to ask).
13. Write `## Agent Reference` — one-line identity: who this agent is and its primary function.
14. Write `## Routing Rules` — table with columns: Keywords | Action | Confidence.
15. Write `## Decision Tree` — numbered if/then/else list.
16. Write `## Priorities` — ordered list, highest first.
17. Write `## Heuristics` — actionable rules of thumb.
18. Write `## Domain Map` — what this agent covers vs routes to others.
Byte budget pseudocode:
```
body_bytes = len(encode_utf8(body_content))
# if body_bytes > 2048: compress heuristics, merge similar routing rules
```
**Verification:** `routing_rules` has >= 3 rules. `decision_tree` has >= 2 conditions, each with `condition`, `then`, and `else`. Body <= 2048 bytes. Keywords in routing rules are specific (not "general" or "anything").
### Phase 3: Validate
**Action:** Run all 9 HARD gates from `QUALITY_GATES.md`. Fix any failure before output.
| Gate | Check |
|------|-------|
| H01 | YAML frontmatter parses without error |
| H02 | `id` matches pattern `^p02_mm_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$` |
| H03 | `kind` is literal string `mental_model` |
| H04 | `pillar` is `P02` (NOT P10) |
| H05 | `quality` is `null` |
| H06 | `routing_rules` has >= 3 rules each with keywords + action |
| H07 | `decision_tree` has >= 2 conditions each with condition + then |


## Validation
- Verify output matches expected schema before delivery
- Check all required fields are present and non-empty
- Confirm no template placeholders remain in output


## Edge Cases
- Empty input: return structured error with guidance
- Partial input: fill defaults, flag missing fields
- Oversized input: truncate with warning, preserve structure
