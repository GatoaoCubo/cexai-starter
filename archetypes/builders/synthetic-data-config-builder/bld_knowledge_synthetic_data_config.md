# Domain Knowledge: synthetic_data_config
## Executive Summary
Synthetic data configs define how to generate artificial training data for LLM fine-tuning, evaluation, or augmentation. They specify the generation method (self-instruct, evol-instruct, backtranslation), source model, output format, quality filters, and decontamination rules. A synthetic_data_config is a P01 artifact -- it configures the DATA GENERATION process, not the model training itself.
## Spec Table
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Pillar | P01 (knowledge) |
| Generation methods | self-instruct, evol-instruct, backtranslation, paraphrase, seed-expand |
| Quality filters | perplexity, dedup, length, toxicity, relevance |
| Output formats | JSONL, Alpaca, ShareGPT, ChatML |
| Decontamination | n-gram overlap removal against eval sets |
## Patterns
- **Self-Instruct** -- LLM generates instruction-response pairs from seed examples; cost-effective but quality varies
- **Evol-Instruct** -- iteratively increase complexity of instructions; produces harder training examples
- **Seed expansion** -- start with N human-written examples, expand to 10x-100x via LLM generation
- **Quality filtering** -- always filter generated data; perplexity threshold removes incoherent samples
- **Decontamination** -- mandatory before evaluation; remove overlap with benchmark test sets
- **Diversity** -- track topic/format distribution to avoid mode collapse in generated data
## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why it fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| No quality filter | Generated data contains noise that degrades fine-tuned model |
| No decontamination | Benchmark scores inflated by training on test data |
| Single seed example | Generated data lacks diversity, overfits to seed style |
| No format validation | Malformed outputs break training pipeline |
| Ignoring source model bias | Generated data inherits and amplifies source model weaknesses |
| No cost tracking | Generation costs accumulate without budget awareness |
