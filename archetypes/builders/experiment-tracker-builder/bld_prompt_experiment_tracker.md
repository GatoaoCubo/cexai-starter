## Phase 1: FRAME
1. Define experiment_id (UUID or monotonic), experiment_name, project/workspace, owner.
2. Identify research question and falsifiable hypothesis (if/then structure).
3. Enumerate hyperparameters to sweep vs. hold constant; pick search strategy (grid, random, bayes).
4. Select primary metric (single scalar to optimize) and secondary metrics (observability).
5. Bind dataset_ref (point to dataset_card id + version) and model_architecture_ref.

## Phase 2: INSTRUMENT
1. Declare metric schema: name, type (scalar/histogram/image), frequency (per-step/per-epoch), direction (min/max).
2. Declare artifacts: checkpoints, configs, logs, predictions. Size budget per run.
3. Capture environment: git SHA, python version, torch/jax version, GPU type, OS.
4. Set tags: phase (dev/staging/prod), team, tracker-backend (mlflow/wandb/neptune/comet/dvc).
5. Attach run to parent experiment; define sweep_id if parameter search.

## Phase 3: EXECUTE
1. Log params once at run start (immutable).
2. Log metrics continuously; flush at epoch boundaries to survive crashes.
3. Log artifacts at checkpoints and final state; version with content hash.
4. Emit STATUS transitions: QUEUED -> RUNNING -> FINISHED | FAILED | KILLED.
5. On failure: log stack trace to artifacts, preserve last-known-good checkpoint.

## Phase 4: GOVERN
1. Enforce reproducibility: seeds logged, dataset version pinned, env captured.
2. Validate metric schema stays stable across runs (schema drift prevention).
3. Link child runs to parent sweep; compute pareto-front for multi-metric sweeps.
4. Write frontmatter per bld_schema_experiment_tracker.md; populate body per bld_output_template_experiment_tracker.md.
5. Gate via bld_quality_gate_experiment_tracker.md; compile and commit.
