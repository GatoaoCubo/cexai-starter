## Observation
Builders often struggle with managing the lifecycle of the tracker, leading to data loss during experiment crashes. There is also a common tendency to overlook the need for a unified, versioned schema, which prevents meaningful longitudinal comparisons.

## Pattern
Effective builders utilize a factory pattern to instantiate trackers with specific backends (e.g., local, MLflow, or WandB). Decoupling the data collection interface from the storage implementation ensures the system remains extensible and testable.

## Evidence
Reviewed tracker-builder implementations show that a provider-agnostic API is essential for supporting multiple logging backends.

## Recommendations
* Use a factory pattern to instantiate trackers based on configuration.
* Enforce a strict, versioned schema for all recorded metrics and parameters.
* Implement automatic environment snapshots (e.g., git commit, library versions).
* Decouple the logging interface from the specific storage backend.
* Provide a mechanism to reconstruct experiment state from logged metadata.
