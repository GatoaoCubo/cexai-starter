## Domain Overview
In the MLOps lifecycle, an experiment tracker serves as the centralized system of record for all iterative model development. It captures the "how" and "what" of training processes, ensuring that every hyperparameter tuning session, architecture change, and data version is documented for auditability and reproducibility.

Beyond simple logging, modern trackers manage the complex lineage between code, data, and model weights. This enables researchers to compare performance across hundreds of runs, identify regressions, and facilitate the transition from experimental research to production-ready models by providing a verifiable history of model evolution.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Definition | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Run | A single execution of a training script or process | MLflow |
| Experiment | A logical grouping of related runs | W&B |
| Hyperparameter | Configurable parameters set before execution | ML Engineering |
| Metric | Quantitative output used to evaluate performance | MLOps |
| Artifact | Large files like model weights or datasets | DVC |
| Lineage | The history of data/code transformations | Data Engineering |
| Metadata | Contextual information about a specific run | Industry Standard |
| Tag | Key-value pairs for filtering and organizing | Comet.ml |
| Checkpoint | Saved state of a model during training | PyTorch |
| Registry | Centralized store for approved model versions | MLflow |

## Industry Standards
- MLflow (Tracking and Model Registry)
- Weights & Biases (Experiment Management)
- TensorBoard (Visualization)
- DVC (Data and Pipeline Versioning)
- Comet.ml (Experiment Tracking)

## Common Patterns
1. Hierarchical Grouping: Organizing runs into nested experiment folders for scale.
2. Automated Environment Capture: Logging Conda/Pip dependencies automatically.
3. Metric Smoothing: Applying moving averages to noisy training curves.
4. Parent-Child Runs: Linking hyperparameter sweeps to base configurations.
5. Artifact Versioning: Linking specific model weights to the exact dataset version.

## Pitfalls
- Hardcoding file paths instead of using relative artifact paths.
- Failing to log the random seed, breaking reproducibility.
- Logging high-frequency metrics that bloat database storage.
- Neglecting to capture the Git SHA for code-to-model lineage.
- Overlooking the importance of logging the training environment/OS.
