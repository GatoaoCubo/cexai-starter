# Memory — Learnings

This ISO describes a software project: its repository layout, modules, and build graph.

## From codexa-core (Production)

### L01: CORS Middleware Must Be Outermost
**Problem**: Auth middleware returned 401/403 but browser blocked response (no CORS headers).
**Solution**: Add CORSMiddleware LAST (FastAPI processes last-added first).
**Impact**: All error responses now include CORS headers.

### L02: Environment Variables Before App Import
**Problem**: Tests importing app before setting env vars caused config errors.
**Solution**: Set `os.environ["ENV"] = "test"` BEFORE `from api.main import app`.
**Impact**: Consistent test behavior, no env pollution.

### L03: Multi-Stage Docker Saves 600MB
**Problem**: Single-stage image was 800MB+ (includes gcc, build tools).
**Solution**: Builder stage installs deps → Runtime stage copies only venv.
**Impact**: 200MB runtime image, faster deploys, smaller attack surface.

### L04: pytest Markers Save 80% CI Time
**Problem**: Full test suite took 5min, blocking PRs.
**Solution**: Mark slow/integration tests, run `pytest -m "not slow"` in CI.
**Impact**: PR checks complete in 60s. Full suite runs nightly.

### L05: Railway Rollback Is Instant
**Problem**: Bad deploy broke production, manual fix took 20min.
**Solution**: `railway rollback` reverts to previous build in <30s.
**Impact**: Zero-downtime recovery for deploy failures.

### L06: Hatchling Build Is Fastest
**Problem**: setuptools build took 15s, required setup.py.
**Solution**: Switch to hatchling (pure Python, no C compilation).
**Impact**: Build in <2s, single pyproject.toml config.

### L07: Body Size Limit Prevents OOM
**Problem**: Large POST payloads caused API worker to OOM crash.
**Solution**: Middleware checks Content-Length before processing.
**Impact**: 413 response for >5MB payloads, no more OOM.

### L08: Structured Logging with Request IDs
**Problem**: Couldn't trace errors across middleware→handler→service.
**Solution**: ContextVar-based request_id in every log line.
**Impact**: Full request tracing with `grep request_id` in logs.

## From CEX Tools Development

### L09: `_clean_llm_output()` Is Essential
**Problem**: LLM returned markdown with ```yaml blocks, breaking parsing.
**Solution**: Strip everything before first `---` in 8F runner.
**Impact**: 100% reliable artifact production.

### L10: Score Normalization Prevents Inflation
**Problem**: First scorer gave everything 9.5+.
**Solution**: Normalized to 8.0-9.3 range with 5D heuristics.
**Impact**: Meaningful quality differentiation.
