## Observation
Common issues include over-allocating resources for simple queries or under-allocating for complex ones, leading to inefficiency or timeouts. Strategies often fail to balance latency and accuracy trade-offs during inference.

## Pattern
Effective strategies dynamically allocate compute based on query complexity, using lightweight models for simple tasks and heavier ones for demanding cases. Prioritizing resource allocation for high-impact queries improves overall system efficiency.

## Evidence
Reviewed artifacts showed 20% latency reduction when using query-based compute tiers compared to static allocation.

## Recommendations
- Use query profiling to predict resource needs during inference.
- Implement tiered compute allocation for varying query complexity.
- Monitor real-time performance to adjust resource distribution.
- Avoid static allocation; favor adaptive strategies.
- Align compute budgets with business priorities (e.g., accuracy vs. speed).
