## Domain Overview  
Search_strategy artifacts define how systems allocate computational resources during inference phases of search or retrieval tasks. In modern AI/ML pipelines, inference-time compute allocation balances latency, accuracy, and resource constraints, especially in distributed or edge environments. Strategies must account for dynamic workloads, heterogeneous hardware (e.g., GPUs, TPUs), and varying query complexity. Key challenges include avoiding over-provisioning, ensuring fairness across concurrent requests, and aligning with service-level agreements (SLAs).  

This domain overlaps with MLOps and system optimization, leveraging techniques from both machine learning and distributed computing. For example, large language models (LLMs) require strategies to manage token generation costs, while search engines optimize query routing based on real-time load. The focus is on runtime decisions, not static model training or document retrieval mechanics.

## Industry Standards  
- MLPerf Inference Benchmark  
- Hugging Face Transformers Library  
- Apache Flink Stream Processing Framework  
- ONNX Runtime Optimization Guidelines  
- Google TFX for MLOps Pipelines  
- AWS Lambda Provisioned Concurrency  
- Kubernetes Resource Management Policies  
- NeurIPS Paper: “Edge-Aware Inference Scheduling” (2022)  
- ICML Paper: “Dynamic Compute Allocation for LLMs” (2021)  

## Common Patterns  
1. Prioritize high-impact queries using SLA-based scoring.  
2. Apply latency budgets to enforce hard response-time limits.  
3. Use dynamic scaling to match resource allocation with real-time demand.  
4. Implement tiered execution for heterogeneous hardware environments.  
5. Employ early stopping in iterative algorithms to reduce compute waste.  
6. Decompose complex queries into parallelizable subtasks.  

## Pitfalls  
- Over-allocating resources without monitoring actual usage.  
- Ignoring latency budgets, leading to user-facing timeouts.  
- Poor workload profiling causing misaligned resource predictions.  
- Neglecting cache invalidation, resulting in stale or redundant computations.  
- Rigid strategies that fail to adapt to sudden workload spikes.
