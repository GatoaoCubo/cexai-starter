## Observation
Misconfigured entity IDs or mismatched SLO URLs often cause SAML/OIDC flows to fail. Overlooking attribute mapping rules can lead to incomplete user profile data post-authentication.

## Pattern
Using standardized templates for metadata alignment ensures compatibility across IdPs. Modular configuration blocks for protocol-specific settings (e.g., SAML vs. OIDC) improve maintainability.

## Evidence
Reviewed SAML configs with correct entity ID and OIDC configs referencing well-known endpoints demonstrated successful integration.

## Recommendations
- Use IdP-provided metadata to auto-populate entity IDs and endpoints.
- Validate attribute mappings against IdP schema during config generation.
- Separate protocol-specific settings into reusable configuration modules.
- Enforce SLO/SSO URL consistency across all service provider configs.
- Document IdP-specific quirks (e.g., custom attribute formats) in config comments.
