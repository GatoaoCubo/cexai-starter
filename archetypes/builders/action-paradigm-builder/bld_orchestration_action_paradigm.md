## Crew Role
Orchestrates action execution workflows, decomposing high-level goals into executable steps, ensuring alignment with domain constraints and resource availability.

## Receives From
| Builder       | What               | Format      |
|---------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Task Planner  | Goal definitions   | JSON        |
| ResourceMgr   | Available resources| YAML        |
| Validator     | Constraint rules   | Structured  |
| Monitor       | Status updates     | JSON        |

## Produces For
| Builder       | What               | Format      |
|---------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Executor      | Action plan        | JSON        |
| Logger        | Execution logs     | YAML        |
| FeedbackSys   | Completion signals | Structured  |
| ErrorHandler  | Failure reports    | JSON        |

## Boundary
Does NOT execute actions directly (handled by cli_tool/api_client builders), manage user interfaces
(handled by agent_computer_interface builder), or handle sequential task ordering (handled by
workflow builder).
