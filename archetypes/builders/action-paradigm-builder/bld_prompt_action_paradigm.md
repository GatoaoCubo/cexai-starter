## Phase 1: RESEARCH  
1. Analyze existing action paradigms (e.g., reactive, deliberative, hybrid).  
2. Map agent-environment interaction models (e.g., state-action spaces, reward functions).  
3. Study action representation formats (e.g., discrete, continuous, symbolic).  
4. Investigate execution mechanisms (e.g., rule-based, learning-based, hybrid).  
5. Review validation criteria for action reliability and adaptability.  
6. Document case studies of successful action paradigm implementations.  

## Phase 2: COMPOSE  
1. Define schema structure per SCHEMA.md (action types, parameters, outcomes).  
2. Specify function CALL interface (input: environment state; output: action).  
3. Map action types to environment-specific APIs (e.g., robotics, simulation).  
4. Write execution logic for each action type (e.g., planning, reacting, learning).  
5. Integrate validation hooks (e.g., pre/post-condition checks, error handling).  
6. Use OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md to format artifact (e.g., YAML, JSON, code blocks).  
7. Add examples for each action type with environment-specific parameters.  
8. Embed references to research findings (Phase 1) in artifact metadata.  
9. Finalize artifact with versioning, authorship, and usage guidelines.  

## Phase 3: VALIDATE  
1. [ ] Verify schema compliance with SCHEMA.md (all required fields present).  
2. [ ] Confirm action_type is classified (reactive/deliberative/hierarchical/hybrid).  
3. [ ] Verify preconditions and postconditions are defined for all actions.  
4. [ ] Confirm failure recovery is documented for each action class.  
5. [ ] Validate id matches pattern: p04_act_[a-z0-9_]+  
6. [ ] Run H01-H08 quality gate checks before delivering.
