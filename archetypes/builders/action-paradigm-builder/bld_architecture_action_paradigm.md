## Architectural Position
action_paradigm sits in P04 (Tools layer) as the behavioral specification for autonomous agent
execution. It is consumed by execution engines (robotics middleware, agent frameworks, simulation
platforms) that instantiate the paradigm at runtime. It sits above protocol interfaces (cli_tool,
api_client) and below orchestration sequences (workflow, dispatch_rule).
