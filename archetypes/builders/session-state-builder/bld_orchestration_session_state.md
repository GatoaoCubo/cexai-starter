# Collaboration: session-state-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "what is the agent's current session state right now?"
I capture ephemeral in-session snapshots — context window usage, active task, checkpoint progress, and recovery pointers. I do NOT handle persistent state across sessions (runtime-state-builder), accumulated learning over time (learning-record-builder), or search indexes.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Agent Resilience System"
```
  1. session-state-builder  -> "snapshots ephemeral context: tokens used, current task, checkpoint"
  2. runtime-state-builder  -> "persists durable state that survives session boundaries"
  3. fallback-chain-builder -> "uses checkpoint data from session_state to define recovery paths"
```
### Crew: "Long-Running Task Coordination"
```
  1. session-state-builder -> "captures mid-execution checkpoint so work can resume after interruption"
  2. signal-builder        -> "emits a progress signal derived from the session_state checkpoint data"
  3. handoff-builder       -> "packages session state + progress signal into a resumable handoff"
```
### Crew: "Context Overflow Protection"
```
  1. session-state-builder -> "tracks tokens_used and context_window fields to detect overflow risk"
  2. skill-builder         -> "defines the overflow-protection skill that reads session state and compresses"
  3. lifecycle-rule-builder -> "establishes rules for when to checkpoint based on session state thresholds"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: agent ID, current task description, tokens used, active tool calls
- optional: checkpoint label, recovery pointer, priority queue of pending items
### I Produce
- session_state artifact (YAML, fields: agent_id, task, tokens_used, checkpoint, timestamp, max 80 lines)
- committed to: `cex/P10/examples/session-state-{agent}-{timestamp}.yaml`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons
## Builders I Depend On
- None required. Session state is captured from live agent execution context.
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| runtime-state-builder  | promotes durable fields from session_state into persistent storage |
| fallback-chain-builder | reads checkpoint data from session_state to define recovery entry points |
| signal-builder         | extracts progress percentage from session_state to populate progress signals |
| handoff-builder        | embeds session_state snapshot into handoff for cross-session resumption |
