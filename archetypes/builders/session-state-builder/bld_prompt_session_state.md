## Context
The session-state-builder produces `session_state` artifacts — ephemeral YAML snapshots
that capture an agent's momentary execution state during a live session. A session_state
records what the agent is currently doing, what resources it has consumed, and where
recovery checkpoints exist if the session is interrupted.

**Input contract**:
- `{{agent_name}}`: the agent or agent_group being snapshotted (e.g. `build-sat`, `research-agent`)
- `{{session_id}}`: unique identifier for this execution context (e.g. `sess_20260327_001`)
- `{{session_status}}`: one of `active`, `paused`, `completed`, `aborted`
- `{{started_at}}`: ISO 8601 timestamp of session start
- `{{context_data}}`: optional free-text description of current tasks and state
**Output contract**: A single `session_state` YAML file named `p10_ss_`{{session_slug}}`.yaml`,
under 3072 bytes, with required frontmatter and three body sections: Active Context,
Resource Usage, and Checkpoints.
**Boundaries**:
- session_state is ephemeral — it captures a moment, not accumulated history.
- Accumulated learning across sessions belongs in a learning_record artifact.
- Persistent runtime state that outlasts a session belongs in a runtime_state artifact.
- Search indexes and knowledge bases are separate artifacts entirely.
- Absent optional fields must be omitted, not filled with placeholder values.
## Phases
### Phase 1: Capture
**Primary action**: Collect all observable facts about the current session state before
writing any YAML.
```
INPUT: agent_name, session_id, session_status, started_at, context_data
1. Derive session_slug for the filename:
   session_slug = session_id.lower().replace(" ", "_").replace("-", "_")
   Verify slug matches pattern: ^[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$

2. Resolve session_status to one of the four valid values:
   active    -> agent is currently executing
   paused    -> agent is waiting for external input or resource
   completed -> agent finished all assigned work
   aborted   -> session terminated before completion

3. Extract current tasks from context_data (if provided):
   current_tasks = list of task descriptions the agent is mid-execution on
   if context_data is empty: current_tasks = []
4. Estimate resource usage from available signals:
   tokens_used: integer or null

   tools_invoked: list of tool names or []
   elapsed_seconds: integer or null
   error_count: integer, default 0
5. Identify recovery checkpoints (if any):
   checkpoint = {

     label: short name (e.g. "after_phase_2"),
     description: what was completed up to this point,
     resumable: true | false
   }
   checkpoints = [] if none exist

OUTPUT: session_slug, session_status, current_tasks[], resource_usage{},
        checkpoints[]
```
Verification: `session_slug` matches naming pattern. `session_status` is one of four
valid values.
### Phase 2: Compose
**Primary action**: Assemble the captured data into a valid session_state YAML artifact
following the schema exactly.
```
INPUT: all outputs from Phase 1, agent_name, session_id, started_at
1. Set filename: p10_ss_{{session_slug}}.yaml
2. Assemble frontmatter (required fields):
   id: p10_ss_{{session_slug}}

   kind: session_state
   pillar: P10
   version: 1.0.0
   agent: {{agent_name}}
   session_id: {{session_id}}

   status: {{session_status}}
   started_at: {{started_at}}
   captured_at: current ISO 8601 timestamp
   quality: null
3. Write Active Context section:

   List current_tasks as bullet items.
   If current_tasks is empty: write "No active tasks — session is {{session_status}}."
4. Write Resource Usage section:
   Emit only fields with known values. Omit fields where value is null unless
   null is the correct documented value (e.g. tokens_used: null is valid when

   token counting is unavailable).
   resource_usage:
     tokens_used: {{tokens_used}}
     tools_invoked: {{tools_invoked}}
     elapsed_seconds: {{elapsed_seconds}}

     error_count: {{error_count}}
5. Write Checkpoints section:
   If checkpoints is non-empty: emit as YAML list with label, description, resumable.
   If checkpoints is empty: write "checkpoints: []"
6. Size check:

   Estimate byte count of assembled YAML.
   If estimate > 3072 bytes:
     Truncate current_tasks to the 3 most recent items.
     Truncate tools_invoked to the 10 most recent entries.
     Re-estimate. If still > 3072: remove optional narrative fields.

OUTPUT: session_state YAML content (assembled, not yet validated)
```
Verification: file is named `p10_ss_`{{session_slug}}`.yaml`. Estimated size <= 3072 bytes.
### Phase 3: Validate
**Primary action**: Run all quality gates against the assembled artifact and output the
final file only if all HARD gates pass.
```
INPUT: session_state YAML content
1. HARD quality gates (all must pass):
   HARD_1: id matches pattern ^p10_ss_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$
   HARD_2: kind == "session_state"

   HARD_3: status is one of active/paused/completed/aborted
   HARD_4: started_at is valid ISO 8601 timestamp
   HARD_5: captured_at is valid ISO 8601 timestamp
   HARD_6: quality == null
   HARD_7: artifact size <= 3072 bytes

   HARD_8: no placeholder values present ({{...}}, TBD, N/A as strings)
2. Boundary check:
