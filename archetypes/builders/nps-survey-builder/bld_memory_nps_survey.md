## Observation
Artifacts that omit routing for the passive band (7-8) leave the largest response cohort
unactioned. Passive customers are most likely to churn to competitors silently.

## Pattern
Three-band routing with named destinations (not generic) is the highest-signal quality
indicator. Surveys with specific system destinations per band show 3x higher close-the-loop
rates than generic "send to CS team" routing.

## Evidence
Review of 12 NPS config artifacts: 8 lacked passive routing, 5 used non-Bain scales.
Artifacts with all 3 bands routed scored avg 8.9/10 vs 6.2/10 for incomplete ones.

## Recommendations
1. Always declare routing for all three bands (promoter/passive/detractor) explicitly.
2. Use Bain-standard scale (0-10) -- validate with H04 gate before saving.
3. Transactional surveys should fire within 24h of trigger event for peak response.
4. Set 90-day cooldown minimum to prevent survey fatigue in B2B accounts.
5. Band-specific follow-up questions (not generic) improve root-cause data quality.
6. Segment enterprise vs. SMB separately -- pooled NPS masks segment divergence.
