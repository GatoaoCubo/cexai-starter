## Survey Configuration
question: "On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend {{product_name}} to a colleague?"
scale:
  min: 0
  max: 10
  labels:
    0: "Not at all likely"
    10: "Extremely likely"
follow_up:
  promoter: "What do you love most about {{product_name}}?"
  passive: "What one thing would make {{product_name}} better for you?"
  detractor: "What is the most important improvement we could make?"

## Segmentation
filters:
  - field: customer_tier
    values: [{{tier_values}}]    # e.g., enterprise, mid-market
  - field: tenure_days
    operator: ">="
    value: {{min_tenure}}        # e.g., 30
  - field: region
    values: [{{regions}}]

exclusion_rules:
  - surveyed_within_days: 90
  - status: churned

## Cadence Rules
trigger: {{trigger}}             # e.g., post_onboarding, post_support_close, quarterly_cron
cooldown_days: {{cooldown}}      # e.g., 90
max_per_year: {{max_per_year}}   # e.g., 4

## Score Routing
promoter:   # 9-10
  destination: {{promoter_destination}}   # e.g., success_team_expansion_queue
  action: flag_for_referral

passive:    # 7-8
  destination: {{passive_destination}}    # e.g., nurture_sequence
  action: schedule_qbr

detractor:  # 0-6
  destination: {{detractor_destination}}  # e.g., support_escalation_queue
  action: create_ticket_priority_high
