## Architectural Position
nps_survey sits in P11/GOVERN: it is a governance artifact that configures how NPS
data is collected, segmented, and routed. It feeds into retention workflows (P12),
customer-health dashboards (N06), and churn-prevention playbooks (P03). It does NOT
define customer segments (customer_segment kind) nor analyse cohorts (cohort_analysis).
