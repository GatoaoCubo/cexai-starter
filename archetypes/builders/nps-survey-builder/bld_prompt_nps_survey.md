## Phase 1: RESEARCH  
1. Define survey purpose: Align with P11 governance goals (e.g., customer loyalty, product feedback).  
2. Identify target audience: Segment by user type, tenure, or product usage.  
3. Draft core question: Use standard NPS phrasing (e.g., “How likely are you to recommend [product]?”).  
4. Select scale: Confirm 0–10 numerical scale with verbal anchors (e.g., 0=“Not at all likely,” 10=“Extremely likely”).  
5. Design follow-up: Create open-ended questions for promoters/detractors (e.g., “Why?”).  
6. Determine cadence: Set frequency (e.g., post-interaction, quarterly) and triggers (e.g., transactional events).  

## Phase 2: COMPOSE  
1. Reference SCHEMA.md: Define `survey_id`, `pillar`, `function`, and `version`.  
2. Write question text: Use concise, neutral language per OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md.  
3. Configure scale: Map numerical values to verbal labels (e.g., 0–2=Detractors, 9–10=Promoters).  
4. Structure follow-up: Add conditional questions based on NPS score (e.g., “What could we improve?” for detractors).  
5. Segment respondents: Apply filters (e.g., `user_type=enterprise`, `region=APAC`).  
6. Set cadence rules: Define timing (e.g., `post_onboarding`, `30_days_after_sign_up`).  
7. Route responses: Link scores to workflows (e.g., `score<3 → support_ticket`, `score>8 → success_team`).  
8. Validate against OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md: Ensure all fields (e.g., `question`, `scale`, `routing`) are present.  
9. Finalize artifact: Save as `nps_survey.yaml` with metadata (e.g., `created_by`, `last_modified`).  

## Phase 3: VALIDATE  
- [ ] ✅ Schema compliance: All required fields in SCHEMA.md are populated.  
- [ ] ✅ Flow logic: Follow-up questions trigger correctly based on NPS score.  
- [ ] ✅ Segmentation: Filters match target audience definitions (Phase 1, Step 2).  
- [ ] ✅ Routing: Response paths align with governance workflows (e.g., `score<3 → support`).  
- [ ] ✅ Cadence: Timing rules match research phase (Phase 1, Step 6).
