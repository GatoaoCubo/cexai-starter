# Domain Knowledge: rag_source
## Executive Summary
A rag_source is a pointer-only artifact that catalogs an external indexable URL for RAG pipelines — it records WHERE content lives, not the content itself. Body max is 1024 bytes. If the body contains extracted text paragraphs, the artifact is a knowledge_card, not a rag_source. Two files are always required: `.md` (human-readable) and `.yaml` (machine twin), both sharing the same `id`.
## Spec Table
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Pillar | P01 (knowledge) |
| ID pattern | `^p01_rs_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$` |
| Required frontmatter fields | 13 (includes `url` and `last_checked`) |
| Recommended fields | 4 (keywords, reliability, format, extraction_method) |
| Max body | 1024 bytes |
| Body sections | 3 (Source Description, Freshness Policy, Extraction Notes) |
| Dual-file artifact | `.md` + `.yaml` twin; IDs must match |
| `quality` field | ALWAYS null |
## Patterns
| Pattern | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Pointer discipline | Body describes metadata about the source; never contains extracted content |
| Dual-file requirement | Both `.md` and `.yaml` required; id must be identical in both |
| Freshness policy | Specify re-check cadence + staleness threshold (e.g., stale after 30 days) |
| `last_checked` update | Must be updated on each URL validation; not synonymous with `created` |
| Reliability levels | `high` = official docs/APIs; `medium` = curated third-party; `low` = informal/social |
| Format field | `html` / `json` / `api` / `pdf` / `csv` — drives extraction_method choice |
| URL preference | `https://` preferred; HTTP must be documented as deliberate exception |
## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why it fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| Body contains extracted paragraphs | Wrong kind — this is a knowledge_card, not a rag_source |
| Missing `url` field | Core identifier; HARD gate H06 blocks on absent required fields |
| `last_checked` equals `created` and never updated | Freshness policy is meaningless; indexer cannot determine staleness |
| No `## Freshness Policy` section | Body section is mandatory; artifact fails structural gate |
| Body > 1024 bytes | Violates hard size constraint; artifact is rejected |
| `.md` and `.yaml` twins with mismatched `id` | Schema integrity failure; lookup by ID breaks |
| `reliability` omitted | Downstream retrieval cannot weight source trustworthiness |
## Application
1. Identify the external URL; validate format (`https://`) and reachability
2. Write frontmatter: 13 required fields including `url`, `domain`, `last_checked`; `quality: null`
3. Add recommended fields: `reliability` (high/medium/low), `format`, `extraction_method`, `keywords` (3–8 terms)
4. Write `## Source Description` — what the source is, who maintains it, why it is authoritative
5. Write `## Freshness Policy` — re-check cadence + staleness threshold
6. Write `## Extraction Notes` — method, auth requirements, pagetion quirks
7. Verify body <= 1024 bytes; create `.yaml` machine twin with identical `id`
