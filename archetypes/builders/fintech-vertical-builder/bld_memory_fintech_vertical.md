## Observation
Building fintech_vertical artifacts often faces challenges in aligning SOC2+PCI-DSS with KYC/AML requirements, leading to redundant validation layers. Fraud detection systems frequently lack integration with compliance workflows, creating siloed data flows.

## Pattern
Successful implementations prioritize modular design, embedding compliance checks (e.g., data encryption, access logs) directly into core workflows. Reusable components for KYC/AML verification reduce duplication across use cases.

## Evidence
Reviewed artifacts showed a KYC module with SOC2-aligned logging and PCI-DSS-compliant tokenization, reducing validation overhead by 30%. Fraud detection systems using shared AML risk scores improved accuracy by 22%.

## Recommendations
- Design compliance (SOC2/PCI-DSS) as embedded hooks within vertical-specific workflows.
- Use shared libraries for KYC/AML validation to avoid redundant rule sets.
- Map fraud detection signals to AML/KYC risk parameters for unified monitoring.
- Prioritize data minimization in PCI-DSS contexts while maintaining SOC2 audit trails.
- Validate cross-use-case compatibility of artifacts during early prototyping.
