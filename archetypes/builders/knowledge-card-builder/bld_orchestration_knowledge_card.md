# Collaboration: knowledge-card-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "what is the essential, searchable fact about this topic?"
I do not define agent personas. I do not configure boot parameters.
I distill knowledge into atomic facts so agents and builders have factual context for decisions.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Content Foundation"
```
  1. context-doc-builder -> "domain scope and background"
  2. knowledge-card-builder -> "atomic searchable facts (density > 0.8)"
  3. glossary-entry-builder -> "term definitions"
  4. few-shot-example-builder -> "format examples grounded in knowledge"
```
### Crew: "New Agent End-to-End"
```
  1. knowledge-card-builder -> "domain knowledge for agent expertise"
  2. agent-builder -> "agent definition shaped by knowledge"
  3. instruction-builder -> "execution steps grounded in facts"
  4. boot-config-builder -> "provider configuration"
  5. agent-package-builder -> "deployable package"
```
### Crew: "RAG Pipeline Setup"
```
  1. knowledge-card-builder -> "content to embed and index"
  2. embedding-config-builder -> "embedding model parameters"
  3. knowledge-index-builder -> "search index configuration"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: topic name, domain, source material or research brief
- optional: density target, classification (domain_kc or meta_kc), related cards
### I Produce
- knowledge_card artifact (.md + .yaml frontmatter, max 5KB, density > 0.8)
- committed to: `cex/P01/examples/p01_kc_{topic}.md`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons
## Builders I Depend On
None — independent builder (layer 0). Knowledge cards are distilled from source material.
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| agent-builder | Agent expertise is grounded in knowledge cards |
| axiom-builder | Axioms are formalized from distilled facts |
| context-doc-builder | Domain docs reference knowledge card facts |
| knowledge-index-builder | Knowledge cards are primary content for indexing |
| instruction-builder | Recipes reference factual knowledge for accuracy |
