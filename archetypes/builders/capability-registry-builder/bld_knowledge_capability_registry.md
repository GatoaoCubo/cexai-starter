## Domain Overview
A capability registry is a searchable catalog of all agents available to a crew orchestrator. It bridges agent definition (what an agent can do) with runtime discovery (which agent to dispatch for a given task). Capability registries are central to multi-agent systems: without them, orchestrators either hardcode routing or rediscover capabilities on every query.

In the A2A protocol (Google/Linux Foundation, v0.3 April 2026), the AgentCard is the canonical capability declaration -- skills, authentication, endpoint, version. A capability_registry aggregates multiple AgentCards into a queryable index. LangChain's ToolRegistry and OpenAI's function-calling schema serve the same role for LLM tool invocation. CEX capability_registry unifies these patterns into a single P08 artifact type.

## Key Concepts
| Concept                | Definition                                                                        | Source |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Agent Card             | Structured capability declaration: name, skills, input/output, endpoint, version  | A2A Protocol v0.3 (Google/LF) |
| Tool Registry          | Catalog of callable tools with schemas; runtime discovery for LLM function-calling | LangChain ToolRegistry |
| Function-calling Schema| JSON Schema describing a callable function for LLM tool use                        | OpenAI API (2023) |
| Ranked Candidates      | Ordered list of agents matching a query, scored by quality/cost/availability       | RAG retrieval pattern |
| Quality Baseline       | Historical quality score for an agent's output (from cex_score.py)                 | CEX scoring (cex_score.py) |
| Availability           | Runtime status of an agent: active, deprecated, or experimental                    | CEX lifecycle |
| Capability Name        | Canonical identifier for what an agent does (verb-noun form)                       | ANS (Agent Name Service) pattern |
| Input Schema           | Kind(s) or format the agent accepts as input                                       | CEX kind system |
| Output Schema          | Kind(s) or format the agent produces as output                                     | CEX kind system |
| Coverage Gap           | Domain or capability with no registered agent                                       | Gap analysis pattern |

## Industry Standards
- A2A Protocol v0.3 (Google/Linux Foundation, April 2026) -- AgentCard discovery
- OpenAI Function-calling spec (2023) -- JSON Schema for tool schemas
- LangChain ToolRegistry pattern -- runtime tool discovery
- Agent Name Service (ANS) -- agent endpoint registration and lookup
- FIPA ACL Agent Directory (historical) -- ancestor of A2A AgentCard registry

## Common Patterns
1. Group entries by layer: builder_sub_agents | nucleus_domain_agents | nucleus_cards.
2. Sort within groups by quality_baseline DESC to surface best candidates first.
3. Use keyword_index for TF-IDF-style retrieval ("who can do X?").
4. Include cost_tokens signal to enable cost-aware routing (prefer low-cost when quality equal).
5. Mark deprecated agents explicitly -- never silently remove from registry.
6. Re-index on every new agent addition (post-build F8 step).

## Pitfalls
- Phantom agent references: listing agents that don't exist as files causes dispatch failures.
- Invented quality scores: use "unscored" for null; never extrapolate or guess.
- Conflating agent layers: builder sub-agents and nucleus domain agents have different invocation paths.
- Stale registry: new builders added without re-indexing leave capabilities undiscoverable.
- Overly broad keyword_index: too many generic terms dilutes relevance ranking.
- Missing coverage_gaps section: orchestrators need to know what CANNOT be done, not just what can.
