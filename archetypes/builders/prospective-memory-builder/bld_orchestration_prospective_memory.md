# Collaboration: prospective-memory-builder

## My Role in Crews
I store the FUTURE INTENTIONS of an agent -- what it commits to do later.
I do not schedule workflow jobs (that is schedule P12). I do not hold current task state (working_memory). I do not record what happened (episodic_memory).

## Crew Compositions

### Crew: "Agent Memory System"
```
  1. working-memory-builder -> "active task state"
  2. episodic-memory-builder -> "past interaction history"
  3. prospective-memory-builder -> "future action intentions"
  4. entity-memory-builder -> "persistent entity facts"
```

## Handoff Protocol

### I Receive
- seeds: owner agent/nucleus, list of future actions and their triggers

### I Produce
- prospective_memory artifact (.md)
- committed to: `N0x_{domain}/P10_memory/p10_pm_{scope}.md`

## Builders I Depend On
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| agent-builder | Agent definition declares which tools the action_payloads reference |
| episodic-memory-builder | Completed reminders are recorded as episodes |

## Conflict Resolution
| Scenario | Resolution |
|----------|-----------|
| prospective_memory vs schedule | prospective = agent intention. schedule = workflow config. Different pillars (P10 vs P12). |
| Future action vs current task | Future -> prospective_memory. Current -> working_memory. |
