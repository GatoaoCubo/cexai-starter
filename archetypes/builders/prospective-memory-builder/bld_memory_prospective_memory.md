## Summary
Prospective memory fails when action payloads are vague. An agent that restarts after context loss reads the reminder and must be able to execute it without any other context. This requires self-contained action payloads.

## Pattern
1. action_payload = full executable instruction (not "check something")
2. trigger_type: always declare one of time, event, condition
3. For time triggers: set expiry for one-shot, recurrence for recurring
4. For condition triggers: polling mechanism must be declared
5. owner: always declare -- orphaned reminders cannot be executed after reboot

## Anti-Pattern
1. action_payload: "do something later" -- not executable
2. No trigger_type -- agent cannot know when to fire
3. No owner -- cannot route on reboot
4. Confusing with schedule (P12) -- schedule is workflow config, not agent memory
