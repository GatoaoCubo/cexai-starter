## Component Inventory
| Name | Role | Owner | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| reminders | Future action intents with triggers | prospective_memory | required |
| owner | Agent/nucleus executing reminders | prospective_memory | required |
| execution_mechanism | How reminders are polled/fired | prospective_memory | required |
| trigger_type | time, event, or condition trigger | reminder | required |
| action_payload | What to do when triggered | reminder | required |
| schedule | P12 workflow orchestration config -- sibling | P12 | sibling |
| session_state | Current session data -- sibling | P10 | sibling |
| episodic_memory | Records of past actions -- sibling | P10 | sibling |

## Boundary Table
| prospective_memory IS | prospective_memory IS NOT |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Agent's future intentions (deferred actions) | Workflow schedule config (that is schedule P12) |
| Memory of what to do later | Memory of what happened (that is episodic_memory) |
| Agent-internal reminder store | Cron job or orchestration primitive |
| Trigger-conditional future actions | Current active task state (that is working_memory) |

## Trigger Type Comparison
| Type | Example | Mechanism |
|------|---------|-----------|
| time | "Check quality scores at 2026-05-01" | datetime or cron |
| event | "After N01 signals complete, do X" | signal polling |
| condition | "When quality_score < 7.0, retrain" | state polling |

## Architecture Checklist

- Verify component inventory is complete (no orphans)
- Validate dependency graph has no cycles
- Cross-reference with boundary table for scope correctness
- Test layer map against actual codebase structure

## Architecture Pattern

```yaml
# Architecture validation
components: inventoried
dependencies: acyclic
boundaries: defined
layers: mapped
```

```bash
python _tools/cex_compile.py {FILE}
python _tools/cex_doctor.py --scope architecture
```
