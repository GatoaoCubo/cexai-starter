# Instructions: How to Produce a prospective_memory

## Phase 1: DEFINE
1. Identify the agent that owns this prospective memory store
2. List the future actions/reminders to schedule
3. For each action, determine trigger_type: time (cron/datetime), event (signal received), condition (state meets criterion)
4. Define action_payload for each: what should the agent do when triggered
5. Set priority for ordering concurrent triggers
6. Determine expiry: when does the reminder become irrelevant
7. Define completion_policy: mark_done (one-shot) or re_schedule (recurring)
8. Identify execution_mechanism: CEX schedule signal, polling, wake notification

## Phase 2: COMPOSE
1. Read SCHEMA.md and OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md
2. Fill frontmatter with all required fields (quality: null)
3. Write reminders array: each entry has trigger, action_payload, priority, expiry
4. Declare owner and execution_mechanism
5. Write Overview: what agent and what kinds of future actions
6. Write Reminders table: trigger type, action, priority, expiry
7. Write Execution section: how reminders are checked and fired
8. Verify body <= 2048 bytes

## Phase 3: VALIDATE
1. Confirm id matches `^p10_pm_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$`
2. Confirm kind == prospective_memory
3. Confirm reminders array has >= 1 entry
4. Confirm each reminder has trigger_type and action_payload
5. Confirm owner declared
6. Cross-check: not schedule kind (no cron workflow config), not session_state (not current session)
7. Revise if score < 8.0
