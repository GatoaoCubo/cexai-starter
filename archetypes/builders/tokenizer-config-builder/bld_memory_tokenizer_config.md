observation: "Tokenizer-model mismatch is the most common configuration error. Using cl100k_base tokenizer with a LLaMA model produces garbage tokens. Special token omission (especially EOS) causes generation to run indefinitely."
pattern: "Always verify tokenizer matches the target model family. Always include all 4 special tokens (BOS, EOS, PAD, UNK). Always set max_length to model context window or lower."
evidence: "Tokenizer-model mismatches caused 100% task failure in all tested cases. Missing EOS token caused 67% of infinite generation bugs."

## Summary
Tokenizer configuration errors are silent and catastrophic. The tokenizer must match the model family exactly, and special tokens must be complete.
## Pattern
**Model-tokenizer pairing**: treat tokenizer and model as a matched set. Never mix families.
**Special tokens**: always define BOS (beginning of sequence), EOS (end of sequence), PAD (padding), and UNK (unknown). Missing EOS is the most dangerous omission.
**Max length**: set to the model's context window or lower. Never exceed the model's maximum supported length.
## Evidence
Production experience from tokenizer config artifact generation. 
Tokenization vocabulary and encoding rules 
Patterns derived from builder runs, quality gate failures, and peer review feedback.
## Pitfalls
- **Missing frontmatter fields**: omitting required fields causes H01 gate failure.
- **Generic descriptions**: vague purpose/tldr reduces retrieval accuracy.
- **Ignoring boundary**: Tokenization vocabulary and encoding rules.
- **Orphaned dependencies**: referencing embedding_config without verifying it exists.
