## Phase 1: RESEARCH  
1. Gather incident details: date, time, affected systems, and user impact.  
2. Identify stakeholders: developers, operators, and compliance officers involved.  
3. Collect logs, error traces, and AI model outputs from the incident window.  
4. Analyze root cause: code defects, data drift, or misconfigured governance rules.  
5. Document timeline: sequence of events with timestamps and responsible parties.  
6. Review AI governance policies and incident response protocols.  

## Phase 2: COMPOSE  
1. Outline sections per SCHEMA.md: summary, timeline, root cause, corrective actions.  
2. Draft incident summary: impact, severity, and initial hypothesis.  
3. Write detailed timeline using OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md’s chronological format.  
4. Describe root cause with technical specifics and policy violations.  
5. Propose corrective actions: code fixes, model retraining, or policy updates.  
6. List lessons learned: systemic gaps and recommendations for prevention.  
7. Attach evidence: logs, model outputs, and stakeholder statements.  
8. Peer-review draft for clarity, completeness, and alignment with SCHEMA.md.  
9. Finalize report with version control and metadata (author, date, incident ID).  

## Phase 3: VALIDATE  
□ All required fields in SCHEMA.md are present.  
□ Timeline aligns with logs and stakeholder accounts.  
□ Root cause analysis cites specific technical or policy failures.  
□ Corrective actions are actionable and measurable.  
□ Report passes compliance check for P11 governance standards.
