## Observation
Incident reports often lack consistent structure, leading to incomplete root cause analysis or omitted mitigation steps. Teams may prioritize speed over depth, resulting in superficial documentation that fails to capture systemic issues.

## Pattern
Successful reports use standardized templates with mandatory sections (e.g., timeline, impact, resolution). Collaborative reviews ensure clarity and completeness, while integrating lessons learned into operational procedures.

## Evidence
Reviewed artifacts showed that reports with detailed timelines and stakeholder interviews had 3x higher resolution accuracy than those relying on fragmented notes. One post-mortem omitted root causes due to premature closure.

## Recommendations
- Enforce template compliance with mandatory fields (e.g., "Root Cause," "Mitigation").
- Conduct peer reviews before finalizing reports to catch gaps.
- Link incident reports to actionable items in runbooks or improvement plans.
- Train teams on critical thinking for root cause analysis (e.g., 5 Whys).
- Automate metadata capture (e.g., timestamps, affected systems) to reduce manual errors.
