## Architectural Position
Incident_report-builder sits within CEX's P11 Feedback pillar as the post-incident documentation module. It consumes outputs from monitoring (trace_config), triage (bugloop), and knowledge systems (learning_record). Post-mortem reports feed upstream into compliance_framework (regulatory breach obligations), threat_model (updated threat surfaces from real incidents), and the knowledge library (P01). Follows NIST SP 800-61 incident lifecycle: Preparation -> Detection -> Containment -> Eradication -> Recovery -> Post-Incident.
