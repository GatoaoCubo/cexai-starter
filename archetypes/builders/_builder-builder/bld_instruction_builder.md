# Instructions: How to Produce a type_builder

## Phase 1: RESEARCH
1. Identify the target type: which kind from the taxonomy needs a builder
2. Read the target type's `_schema.yaml` to understand fields, constraints, and body structure
3. Read `TAXONOMY_LAYERS.yaml` to determine pillar assignment and sibling types
4. Read `SEED_BANK.yaml` for domain vocabulary and keyword candidates
5. Analyze existing builders in `archetypes/builders/` for pattern consistency
6. Identify boundary types: which sibling kinds are frequently confused with the target
7. Determine crew role: what single question does this builder answer

## Phase 2: COMPOSE
1. Read META_MANIFEST.md, META_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md, META_INSTRUCTIONS.md — meta-templates
2. Read META_OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md — fill template following META constraints
3. Generate MANIFEST.md: id, kind (type_builder), pillar, domain, capabilities, routing, crew role
4. Generate SYSTEM_PROMPT.md: persona as domain specialist, 8-12 rules, boundary enforcement
5. Generate INSTRUCTIONS.md: 3-phase pipeline adapted to the target type's complexity
6. Generate KNOWLEDGE.md: domain theory, anti-patterns, size calibration, boundaries
7. Generate SCHEMA.md: all fields from _schema.yaml with types, required/optional, constraints
8. Generate OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md: literal fill-in template with {{variables}}
9. Generate QUALITY_GATES.md: HARD gates (must pass) + SOFT gates (score contribution)
10. Generate remaining files: EXAMPLES.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CONFIG.md, MEMORY.md, COLLABORATION.md, TOOLS.md
11. Set quality: null in every generated artifact (NEVER self-score)

## Phase 3: VALIDATE
1. Check each generated file against its META_ template constraints
2. HARD gates: all 13 files present, YAML parses in every frontmatter, id matches builder naming pattern, kind == type_builder, quality == null everywhere, domain matches target type
3. SOFT gates: capabilities >= 4 bullets, routing keywords >= 4, crew role has exclusions, boundary types listed
4. Cross-check: is every sibling type mentioned in boundaries? Does INSTRUCTIONS.md match SCHEMA.md body sections? Are EXAMPLES.md examples realistic?
5. If score < 8.0: revise weakest file in same pass before outputting
