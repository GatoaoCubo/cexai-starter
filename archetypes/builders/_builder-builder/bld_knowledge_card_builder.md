# Domain Knowledge: _builder (meta)

## Executive Summary

The meta-builder is the factory that produces other builders. It operates one abstraction level above regular builders: while a knowledge-card-builder produces knowledge_cards, the _builder-builder produces the builders themselves. Every builder in the system was either directly generated or validated against the meta-builder's templates and quality gates.

## Spec Table

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Pillar | P02 (agent/builder identity) |
| Output kind | type_builder (any) |
| Required files per builder | MANIFEST, SYSTEM_PROMPT, KNOWLEDGE, INSTRUCTIONS, SCHEMA, EXAMPLES, QUALITY_GATES, CONFIG, ARCHITECTURE, TOOLS, OUTPUT_TEMPLATE, MEMORY, COLLABORATION |
| Meta-file prefix | META_ (e.g., META_MANIFEST.md) |
| llm_function | BECOME (builders assume specialist identity) |
| Naming | {type_name}-builder (kebab-case) |
| Min builder files | 7 (MANIFEST + SYSTEM_PROMPT + KNOWLEDGE + INSTRUCTIONS + SCHEMA + EXAMPLES + QUALITY_GATES) |
| Max builder files | 13 (full complement) |

## Patterns

- **Template-driven generation**: META_ files are fill-in templates with {{variables}} that produce concrete builder files when instantiated with a target type's schema
- **Schema-first**: always read the target type's _schema.yaml before writing any builder file — the schema is the single source of truth for fields, constraints, and validation
- **Capability extraction**: derive builder capabilities directly from the target schema's field count, required fields, and validation rules
- **Boundary mapping**: every builder must explicitly name 3-5 sibling types it does NOT handle, sourced from the same pillar's taxonomy
- **Routing keywords**: 4-8 terms that a user would literally type when searching for this builder via semantic search
- **Crew role pattern**: one question the builder answers + explicit exclusion list

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why it fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| Generic capabilities ("can help with anything") | No routing signal; brain search returns noise |
| Missing boundary section | Builders overlap, producing wrong artifact types |
| Copy-paste from another builder | Domain knowledge is wrong; validation gates don't match |
| Skipping schema read | Field counts, constraints, and validation rules drift from truth |
| Over-scoping (>8 capabilities) | Builder tries to do too much; split into two builders |

## Application

1. Read META_MANIFEST.md template and target type's _schema.yaml
2. Instantiate each META_ file by replacing {{variables}} with concrete values
3. Validate: field counts match schema, boundary types are real siblings, routing keywords are specific
4. Quality gate: all 13 files present, no template residue ({{...}}), density >= 0.80
