# Collaboration: content-monetization-builder

## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "how do we price, bill, package credits, sell
courses, run ads, and send emails for this content business end-to-end?"
I do not write marketing copy. I do not implement payment APIs. I do not deploy services.
I produce monetization architecture + config schema so downstream builders implement and deploy.

## Crew Compositions

### Crew: "Content Monetization End-to-End"
```
1. research-pipeline-builder  → "market intelligence on pricing + competitors"
2. content-monetization-builder → "9-stage monetization config (pricing→deploy)"
3. prompt-template-builder     → "email templates, course descriptions, ad copy briefs"
4. cli-tool-builder            → "checkout orchestrator + credit tracker CLI"
5. api-client-builder          → "Stripe/Hotmart/DS24/email provider clients"
6. spawn-config-builder        → "cron: credit refresh, email scheduler, ad sync"
```

### Crew: "Multi-Platform Launch" (Hotmart BR + DS24 INT)
```
1. research-pipeline-builder    → "platform research: Hotmart+DS24 API, compliance"
2. content-monetization-builder → "dual-platform config: Hotmart(BR) + DS24(INT)"
3. api-client-builder           → "Hotmart webhook (JSON/sha256) + DS24 IPN (form/sha512)"
4. prompt-template-builder      → "copy (PT-BR + EN/DE), email sequences"
5. cli-tool-builder             → "checkout router (geo-detect → provider)"
```

### Crew: "Infoproduct Launch"
```
1. content-monetization-builder → "pricing + checkout + course structure"
2. social-publisher-builder     → "launch campaign posts"
3. prompt-template-builder      → "sales page copy + email sequences"
```

### Crew: "SaaS Credit System"
```
1. content-monetization-builder → "credit economics + tier pricing"
2. api-client-builder           → "usage metering API"
3. db-connector-builder         → "credit ledger schema"
4. notifier-builder             → "low-credit alerts"
```
