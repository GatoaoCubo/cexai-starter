## Domain Overview  
White-label configurations enable SaaS providers to deliver customizable, rebrandable deployments for resellers or enterprise clients. These configurations typically isolate branding, UI/UX, and API integrations from core product logic, allowing resellers to embed the service into their own ecosystems without exposing underlying infrastructure. Key focus areas include dynamic theming, API endpoint customization, and secure credential management. Unlike brand_config (identity-related settings) or env_config (runtime parameters), white_label_config prioritizes reseller-specific overrides while maintaining product integrity.  

The domain intersects with multi-tenancy, API management, and software composition, requiring robust abstractions to balance flexibility with security. Industry adoption spans platforms like CRM, e-commerce, and analytics tools, where resellers demand tailored deployments without compromising upstream functionality.

|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|  
| Customizable UI Components   | Modular UI elements allowing reseller branding overrides                   | W3C UI Accessibility Guidelines     |  
| Branding Assets              | Logos, color schemes, and typography managed externally                   | ISO 20252:2019 (Brand Management)   |  
| API Keys                     | Reseller-specific credentials for external system integration             | OAuth 2.0 (RFC 6749)                |  
| Configuration Templates      | Predefined YAML/JSON structures for reseller overrides                    | OpenAPI Specification (RFC 7807)    |  
| Runtime Environment Isolation| Isolation of reseller-specific settings from core application logic       | RFC 7231 (HTTP/1.1)                 |  
| Brand-Specific Routing       | Custom URL paths or subdomains for reseller deployments                   | RFC 7285 (HTTP/2)                   |  

## Industry Standards  
- OAuth 2.0 (RFC 6749)  
- OpenAPI Specification (RFC 7807)  
- ISO/IEC 2382-1:2011 (Software Terminology)  
- NIST SP 800-57 (Key Management)  

## Common Patterns  
1. **Configuration as Code** – Store white-label settings in versioned files (e.g., YAML).  
2. **Modular UI Frameworks** – Use component-based systems for dynamic theming.  
3. **Abstraction Layers** – Isolate reseller-specific logic from core application code.  
4. **Runtime Injection** – Load reseller configs at deployment via environment variables.  
5. **Policy-Driven Validation** – Enforce schema rules for reseller input consistency.  

## Stripe Connect Sub-Account Model  
White-label platforms commonly use Stripe Connect to manage reseller billing:  
- **Platform account**: owns product, sets pricing floors, collects platform fees (1-3% typical).  
- **Connected (sub) account**: reseller's Stripe account, receives payouts minus platform fee.  
- **Charge types**: Direct charges (reseller controls UX), Destination charges (platform controls UX), Separate charges + transfers (split billing).  
- **OEM licensing model**: platform licenses product to reseller at wholesale price; reseller sets retail price. Margin = retail - wholesale - platform fee.  

## Branding Components (MUST configure in every white_label_config)  
| Component | Config Key | Notes |  
|-----------|------------|-------|  
| Custom domain | `custom_domain` | e.g., app.reseller.com -- requires DNS CNAME |  
| Branded email sender | `email_from_domain` | e.g., noreply@reseller.com -- requires SPF/DKIM |  
| Logo (header) | `logo_url` | PNG/SVG, min 200x50px |  
| Favicon | `favicon_url` | ICO/PNG 32x32 |  
| Primary color | `brand_color_primary` | HEX, used in buttons/links |  
| Co-branded footer | `cobrand_text` | "Powered by [Platform]" or fully white-labeled |  
| Theming API | `theme_api_enabled` | Exposes CSS variable overrides to reseller |  

## Common Patterns  
1. **Configuration as Code** -- Store white-label settings in versioned YAML files.  
2. **Modular UI Frameworks** -- CSS variable injection via theming API for runtime branding.  
3. **Abstraction Layers** -- Isolate reseller logic from core application code.  
4. **Stripe Connect sub-accounts** -- Platform fee model with connected account payouts.  
5. **Policy-Driven Validation** -- Enforce schema rules for reseller input consistency.  
6. **Custom domain provisioning** -- Automated CNAME + SSL cert issuance per reseller.  
7. **OEM licensing tiers** -- Wholesale price + margin floor + retail pricing freedom for reseller.
