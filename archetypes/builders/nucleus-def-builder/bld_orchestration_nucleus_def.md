## Crew Role
Produces formal nucleus_def contracts that make the CEX 8-nucleus fractal architecture
machine-readable and orchestration-ready. Acts as the fractal cartographer that maps
each nucleus's identity, boundaries, and composability contracts.

## Receives From

| Source | What | Format |
|--------|------|--------|
| nucleus_models.yaml | CLI + model bindings per nucleus | YAML |
| N0{X} agent cards | Domain agents, kinds_owned, capabilities | Markdown |
| .claude/rules/n0{X}-*.md | Sin lens, routing rules, domain | Markdown |
| N00_genesis/README.md | Fractal structure, pillar map | Markdown |
| .cex/kinds_meta.json | Pillar assignments, kind boundaries | JSON |
| boot/n0{X}.ps1 | Boot script paths for contract | PowerShell |

## Produces For

| Consumer | What | Format |
|----------|------|--------|
| N07 Orchestrator | Dispatch contracts (role, boot_script, cli_binding) | Markdown |
| cex_router.py | CLI selection input (cli_binding, fallback_chain) | Markdown |
| N04 Knowledge | Indexed nucleus registry for retrieval | Markdown |
| spawn_grid.ps1 | Boot configuration (nucleus_id, boot_script) | Markdown |
| cex_retriever.py | Semantic search target for nucleus queries | Markdown |

## Boundary
Does NOT handle individual agent definitions (handled by agent-builder).
Does NOT handle model provider configuration (handled by model-provider-builder).
Does NOT handle crew assembly logic (handled by collaboration-pattern-builder).
Legal boundaries between nuclei (routing rules) are defined in .claude/rules/ files,
not within nucleus_def artifacts.

## Crew Patterns

### Pattern 1: Nucleus Registry Build
```
nucleus-def-builder (x7, one per N01-N07)
  --> produces: nucleus_def_n01.md through nucleus_def_n07.md
  --> N04 indexes all 7 artifacts
  --> N07 reads registry for dispatch routing
```

### Pattern 2: New Nucleus Registration
```
N03 builder-architect (designs new nucleus)
  --> nucleus-def-builder (formalizes the definition)
  --> N05 operations (validates boot contract)
  --> N07 orchestrator (integrates into dispatch)
```

### Pattern 3: Nucleus Audit
```
N01 intelligence (scans actual nucleus directories)
  --> nucleus-def-builder (updates nucleus_def artifacts)
  --> cex_doctor.py (verifies alignment between def + reality)
```
