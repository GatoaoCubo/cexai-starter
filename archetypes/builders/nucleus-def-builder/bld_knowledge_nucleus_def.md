## Domain Overview
nucleus_def artifacts formalize the 8 CEX nuclei (N00-N07) as composable fractal
primitives. Each nucleus is a concrete instantiation of the N00 Genesis mold: same
12-pillar structure, different domain, different sin-lens, different CLI-binding.

The fractal repeats at 3 scales: N00 defines pillars as folders, N01-N07 implement
them as subdirectories, builders (107 types) implement them as ISO files. A nucleus_def
makes this contract explicit and machine-readable.

nucleus_def is consumed by: N07 (dispatch routing), N04 (knowledge indexing),
cex_router.py (CLI selection), and spawn_grid.ps1 (boot orchestration).

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Definition | Source |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Nucleus | One of 8 CEX processing units (N00-N07), each owning a domain | CEX Architecture |
| Genesis (N00) | Universal mold defining what can exist; N01-N07 instantiate it | N00_genesis/README.md |
| Fractal | Same 12-pillar structure repeating at nucleus/builder/ISO scales | CEX Architecture |
| Sin Lens | Creative archetype driving nucleus behavior (e.g., Gating Wrath) | nucleus rule files |
| CLI Binding | Which CLI executable the nucleus boots (claude/gemini/codex/ollama) | nucleus_models.yaml |
| Model Tier | Capability level: opus (deep reasoning), sonnet (structured), local | nucleus_models.yaml |
| Pillars Owned | Which of P01-P12 this nucleus actually produces artifacts for | agent_card files |
| Crew Template | Composable multi-agent pattern this nucleus can assemble | N07 dispatch rules |
| Domain Agent | Non-builder agent in N0{X}_*/P02_model/ (e.g., railway_superintendent) | agent directories |
| Boot Contract | boot_script + handoff file convention + signal format | the Task tool docs |
| Composability | Nucleus declares upstream inputs + downstream outputs for orchestration | P12 orchestration |
| Agent Card | N0{X}_*/agent_card_n0{X}.md -- capability manifest read by N07 | N0{X} directories |

## Industry Standards
- Multi-agent systems (MAS) architecture -- nucleus = agent node
- Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol -- agent cards declare capabilities
- Actor model (Erlang, Akka) -- nucleus = actor with mailbox (handoff file)
- Microservices -- nucleus = service with defined contract
- Conway's Law -- nucleus boundaries map to domain boundaries
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) -- nucleus = bounded context

## Common Patterns
1. Set pillars_owned to reflect actual artifact output, not aspirational scope.
2. Verify cli_binding from nucleus_models.yaml before writing -- never guess.
3. crew_templates_exposed must name patterns that exist or are planned in N07.
4. domain_agents should enumerate all .md files in N0{X}_*/P02_model/ directory.
5. Boot contract must reference the real handoff file path (n0{X}_task.md).

## Pitfalls
- Claiming all 12 pillars for one nucleus (violates domain boundaries).
- Role/nucleus mismatch (N03 is builder, not operations).
- Missing boot_script breaks N07 dispatch -- nucleus cannot be spawned.
- Stale domain_agents list (agents removed but not updated in nucleus_def).
- Confusing model_tier (sonnet) with model_specific (claude-sonnet-4-6).
