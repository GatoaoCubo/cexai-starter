# Rules: saga Builder

## Hard Constraints
1. EVERY step MUST have a non-null compensating_action
2. steps_count MUST equal len(steps list)
3. topology MUST be specified: choreography | orchestration
4. on_failure MUST be specified at saga level
5. quality MUST be null
6. id pattern: `^p12_saga_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$`
7. max_bytes: 4096 body

## Edge Cases
| Situation | Resolution |
|-----------|-----------|
| Step cannot be undone (e.g., send email) | Use idempotent compensation (send cancellation email) |
| User conflates with workflow | Teach: workflow has no compensation; saga does |
| User wants 2-phase commit | Redirect: 2PC for ACID; saga for eventual consistency |
| Saga too long (>10 steps) | Split into sub-sagas with handoff signals |
| Compensating action may fail | Mark as `retry` on_failure; compensating actions must be idempotent |
| Choreography vs orchestration unclear | Default to orchestration (easier to trace); document rationale |

## Naming Rules
- File: `p12_saga_{name_slug}.md`
- ID: `p12_saga_{name_slug}`
- Tags: MUST include "saga" + domain
