# Collaboration: formatter-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "how should structured data be presented in this format?"
I do not extract data. I do not validate content.
I design output transformations so data is presented in readable, consumable formats.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Output Pipeline"
```
  1. input-schema-builder -> "input data contract"
  2. formatter-builder -> "output transformation rules (JSON/YAML/Markdown/table)"
  3. cli-tool-builder -> "CLI tool that applies the formatter"
```
### Crew: "Report Generation"
```
  1. knowledge-card-builder -> "source facts"
  2. formatter-builder -> "presentation format (table, markdown, HTML)"
  3. diagram-builder -> "visual elements in the report"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: input data type, target output format (JSON, YAML, Markdown, HTML, table)
- optional: template engine, escaping rules, locale, truncation policy
### I Produce
- formatter artifact (.md + .yaml frontmatter)
- committed to: `cex/P05/examples/p05_formatter_{scope}.md`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons
## Builders I Depend On
- input-schema-builder: provides data structure that the formatter transforms
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| cli-tool-builder | CLI tools use formatters for output display |
| few-shot-example-builder | Examples must match formatter output shape |
| action-prompt-builder | Prompts may specify output via formatter rules |
