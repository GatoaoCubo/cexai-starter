## Examples
## Golden Example
```markdown
---
title: "AWS Enterprise SLA"
vendor: "Amazon Web Services, Inc."
effective_date: "2023-10-01"
---
**Uptime Commitment**
AWS guarantees 99.95% monthly uptime for EC2 instances in regions with multiple availability zones. Downtime exceeding this threshold triggers service credits (5% for 1–29 days, 10% for 30+ days).
**Latency SLA**
For AWS Global Accelerator, latency between 50ms and 150ms is guaranteed for 95% of requests in North America. Latency exceeding 150ms for >5% of requests incurs credits.
**Support Commitments**
24/7 enterprise support via phone, email, and chat. Critical issues (e.g., outages) must be resolved within 2 hours; non-critical issues within 24 hours.
**Penalties**
Service credits are issued automatically for breaches. No cap on credits for outages exceeding 30 days.

## Anti-Example 1: Missing Key Metrics

title: "CloudCo Enterprise SLA"
vendor: "CloudCo Inc."
effective_date: "2023-09-15"
---
**Uptime Commitment**
We strive to provide reliable service.
**Support Commitments**
Our team will help you as best as possible.
```
## Why it fails
No quantifiable metrics (uptime, latency, response times) or penalties. Vague language makes enforcement impossible.
## Anti-Example 2: Vague Language

title: "DataCorp SLA"
vendor: "DataCorp Solutions"
effective_date: "2023-08-01"
---
**Uptime Commitment**
High availability is guaranteed.
**Latency SLA**
Low latency is ensured for all users.
**Support Commitments**
Support is available when needed.

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
