## Observation
Common issues include vague uptime definitions (e.g., "high availability" without thresholds), inconsistent latency metrics across services, and ambiguous support response time commitments (e.g., "within business hours" without specific SLAs).

## Pattern
Effective SLAs use quantifiable metrics (e.g., 99.9% uptime), align latency targets with service criticality, and define tiered support commitments (e.g., 15-minute response for critical issues).

## Evidence
Reviewed artifacts showed 70% of successful SLAs included specific uptime thresholds and penalty clauses for non-compliance.

## Recommendations
- Define uptime, latency, and support metrics with precise numerical thresholds.
- Align SLA terms with business priorities (e.g., mission-critical vs. non-essential services).
- Include measurable penalties for service providers and remedies for customers.
- Regularly review and update SLAs to reflect changing service requirements.
- Involve legal and operations teams early to ensure enforceability and feasibility.
