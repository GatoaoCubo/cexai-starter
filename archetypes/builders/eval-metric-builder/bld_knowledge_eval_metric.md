## Domain Overview
Evaluation metrics are quantitative measures used to assess the performance of machine learning models, algorithms, or systems. They provide objective criteria for comparing alternatives, validating claims, and ensuring alignment with business or technical goals. In fields like NLP, computer vision, and recommendation systems, metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, or mean average precision (mAP) are critical for model iteration and deployment. Properly defined metrics ensure reproducibility, fairness, and transparency in AI systems, while poor definitions can lead to misleading conclusions or biased outcomes.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Definition | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Accuracy | Proportion of correct predictions over total predictions | [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) |
| Precision | Ratio of true positives to total predicted positives | [Powers, 2020](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pmcc/PPPW/PPPW10.pdf) |
| Recall | Ratio of true positives to total actual positives | [Fawcett, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865505001986) |
| F1-Score | Harmonic mean of precision and recall | [Hriberšek et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11310) |
| AUC-ROC | Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve | [Hand, 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865509001386) |
| BLEU | Metric for evaluating machine translation quality | [Papineni et al., 2002](https://aclanthology.org/P02-1040.pdf) |
| ROUGE | Metric for assessing text summarization | [Lin, 2004](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-1013) |
| Mean Average Precision (mAP) | Average precision across all classes in object detection | [Everingham et al., 2010](https://www.mmlab.science.unitn.it/activities/visual-recogn/evaluation/papers/everingham10.pdf) |

## Industry Standards
- **MLPerf** (benchmarking metrics for ML systems)
- **ISO/IEC 23050:2021** (AI ethics and evaluation)
- **RFC 7850** (metrics for network protocols)
- **scikit-learn** (standard implementations for ML metrics)
- **GLUE Benchmark** (NLP evaluation suite)
- **Powers, 2020** (evaluation metrics for imbalanced datasets)

## Common Patterns
1. Use task-specific metrics (e.g., BLEU for NLP, mAP for object detection).
2. Balance precision and recall via F1-score or AUC-ROC.
3. Normalize metrics for fair comparison across scales.
4. Incorporate domain-specific constraints (e.g., fairness, bias).
5. Track calibration (e.g., Brier score for probabilistic models).

## Pitfalls
- Overfitting to a single metric, ignoring broader system goals.
- Using accuracy in imbalanced datasets (e.g., medical diagnosis).
- Misinterpreting statistical significance vs. practical impact.
- Neglecting metric alignment with stakeholder needs.
- Failing to account for data distribution shifts during evaluation.
