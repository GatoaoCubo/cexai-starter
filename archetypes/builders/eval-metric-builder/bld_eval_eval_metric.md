## Quality Gate

## Definition

## Examples

## Golden Example
```yaml
---
metric_name: "BLEU Score"
vendor: "Hugging Face"
version: "1.0.0"
description: "Measures the quality of machine translation by comparing generated text to reference translations."
---
**Definition**:
The BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score evaluates generated text by computing precision at the n-gram level (typically 4-grams) and applying a brevity penalty for shorter outputs.

**Calculation**:
1. Compute precision for each n-gram (n=1 to 4).
2. Geometric mean of precision scores.
3. Apply brevity penalty if generated text is shorter than the reference.

**Use Case**:
Assessing machine translation models in multilingual NLP tasks.

**Example**:
Generated: "The cat is on the mat."
Reference: "The cat sits on the mat."
Score: 0.85 (high precision, minor brevity penalty).
```

## Anti-Example 1: Vague Metric Definition
```yaml
---
metric_name: "Quality Check"
vendor: "ExampleCorp"
version: "0.1"
description: "Measures how good something is."
---
**Definition**:
"Quality Check" evaluates outputs based on unspecified criteria.

**Calculation**:
"Calculated using internal methods."

**Use Case**:
"Used for everything."
```
## Why it fails
Lacks specificity in calculation, use case, and criteria. No reproducibility or clarity for users.

## Anti-Example 2: Composite Metric
```yaml
---
metric_name: "Overall Model Performance"
vendor: "MLVendor"
version: "2.0"
description: "Combines accuracy, F1, and BLEU into a single score."
---
**Definition**:
Weighted average of accuracy (40%), F1 score (30%), and BLEU (30%).

**Calculation**:
(0.4 * accuracy) + (0.3 * F1) + (0.3 * BLEU).

**Use Case**:
"General-purpose model evaluation."
```
## Why it fails
Violates the boundary of being a *single* metric. Combines multiple metrics into a composite, making it unsuitable for focused evaluation.

### H_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (HARD)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (min 3 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream or sibling reference
- Gate: REJECT if < 3 entries (auto-populated by cex_wikilink.py at F6.5)

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
