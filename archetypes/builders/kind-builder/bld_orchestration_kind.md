# Collaboration: kind-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am the META-BUILDER. I answer ONE question: "what does a complete builder
package look like for kind X?" I produce the 13-ISO scaffolding that other
builders use to produce domain artifacts. I do not produce domain artifacts
myself. I do not modify the kind registry. I do not deploy or activate builders.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "New Kind Onboarding"
```
  1. N04 (knowledge) -> "create kc_{kind}.md knowledge card for the new kind"
  2. kind-builder -> "scaffold 13-ISO builder package from KC + kinds_meta"
  3. N05 (operations) -> "run cex_doctor + cex_score on the new builder package"
  4. N07 (orchestrator) -> "register builder in dispatch routing, update CLAUDE.md"
```
### Crew: "Builder Quality Improvement"
```
  1. N01 (intelligence) -> "audit existing builder: which ISOs are weak?"
  2. kind-builder -> "regenerate weak ISOs with improved domain content"
  3. N05 (operations) -> "validate regenerated ISOs, regression test"
```
### Crew: "Pillar Expansion"
```
  1. N01 (intelligence) -> "identify missing kinds in pillar P{xx}"
  2. N04 (knowledge) -> "create KCs for each missing kind"
  3. kind-builder -> "scaffold builders for all missing kinds"
  4. N03 (engineering) -> "produce sample artifacts with each new builder"
  5. N05 (operations) -> "validate all new artifacts pass quality gates"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
| Input | Source | Required |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Target kind name | N07 handoff or user request | YES |
| kinds_meta.json entry | .cex/kinds_meta.json | YES |
| Reference builder path | N07 suggestion or auto-selected | RECOMMENDED |
| kc_{kind}.md | P01_knowledge/library/kind/ | RECOMMENDED |
| Pillar schema | P{xx}/_schema.yaml | RECOMMENDED |
### I Produce
| Output | Location | Format |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 13 ISO files | archetypes/builders/{kind}-builder/ | Markdown + YAML frontmatter |
| Sub-agent definition | .claude/agents/{kind}-builder.md | Markdown |
| Completion signal | .cex/runtime/signals/ | JSON signal |
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with file count and validation status)
- if validation fails: signal retry with failure reasons and file list
## Builders I Depend On
| Dependency | Why |
|------------|-----|
| Any existing complete builder | Structural reference template (Phase 2) |
| _shared ISOs | Cross-builder skills (GDP, 8F) injected into all builders |
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| ALL 125+ builders | kind-builder creates their 13-ISO package |
| cex_skill_loader.py | Loader expects the exact 13-file structure kind-builder produces |
| cex_doctor.py | Doctor validates the structure kind-builder creates |
| cex_materialize.py | Materializer generates sub-agents from kind-builder output |
## N07 Dispatch Notes
- N03 is the primary nucleus for kind-builder tasks (builder construction)
- N07 dispatches with: target kind name, reference builder suggestion, relevant KCs
- N07 validates output: 13 files exist, all have quality: null, sub-agent created
- N07 follows up: register new builder in routing, update kind counts in CLAUDE.md
