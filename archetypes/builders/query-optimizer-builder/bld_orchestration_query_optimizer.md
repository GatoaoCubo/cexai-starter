# Collaboration: query-optimizer-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer: "how to optimize queries for better retrieval?"
I do not configure indexes. I do not build retrieval engines.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "RAG Pipeline Optimization"
```
1. query-optimizer-builder -> "query transformation pipeline"
2. embedding-config-builder -> "embedding model configuration"
3. retrieval-evaluator-builder -> "retrieval quality measurement"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: target retrieval system, query patterns, latency requirements
### I Produce
- query_optimizer artifact (.md with YAML frontmatter)
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score)
## Builders I Depend On
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| embedding-config-builder | Embedding-aware query rewriting needs model specs |
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| retrieval-evaluator-builder | Evaluates optimized query effectiveness |
## Integration Points
| Point | Direction | Protocol |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| F8 COLLABORATE | outbound | signal_writer.write_signal() |
| F3 INJECT | inbound | Receives upstream artifacts via handoff |
| search_strategy | upstream | Must exist before query optimizer production |
| retriever_config | upstream | Must exist before query optimizer production |
| rag_source | upstream | Must exist before query optimizer production |
## Dependencies
| Dependency | Required | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| search_strategy | yes | Upstream artifact for query optimizer |
| retriever_config | yes | Upstream artifact for query optimizer |
| rag_source | yes | Upstream artifact for query optimizer |
## Properties
