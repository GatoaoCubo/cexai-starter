observation: "Query optimization without latency budget leads to pipelines that exceed user tolerance (>2s for interactive search). Re-ranking with cross-encoders provides the best precision improvement but is the most expensive step. HyDE is powerful but adds 500ms+ per query."
pattern: "Always set a total latency budget and allocate per step. Start with re-ranking as the single highest-impact technique. Add rewriting only when queries are frequently ambiguous. Use HyDE only when semantic gap is the primary retrieval failure mode."
evidence: "Re-ranking alone improved NDCG@10 by 15% with only 200ms added latency. Adding HyDE improved another 8% but cost 700ms. Rewriting helped 25% of queries but added no value for well-formed queries."

## Summary
Query optimization is an incremental investment. Each technique adds latency and complexity. Start with the highest-impact, lowest-latency technique and justify each addition.
## Pattern
**Re-ranking first**: highest precision improvement per millisecond invested. Start here.
**Latency budgeting**: allocate total budget, then distribute across steps. Exceeding 2s total kills interactive use.
**Conditional techniques**: rewriting helps ambiguous queries but wastes time on well-formed ones. Use query classification to route.
## Evidence
Production experience from query optimizer artifact generation. 
Query transformation and decomposition rules for RAG retrieval 
Patterns derived from builder runs, quality gate failures, and peer review feedback.
## Pitfalls
- **Missing frontmatter fields**: omitting required fields causes H01 gate failure.
- **Generic descriptions**: vague purpose/tldr reduces retrieval accuracy.
- **Ignoring boundary**: Query transformation and decomposition rules for RAG retrieval.
- **Orphaned dependencies**: referencing search_strategy without verifying it exists.
