## Crew Role
Designs and automates renewal stage workflows that protect existing ARR, coordinating CSM outreach, pricing negotiations, and contract close within the 90/60/30-day renewal cadence.

## Receives From
| Builder / Source         | What                              | Format        |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| CRM (Salesforce)         | Contract end dates, ARR, PO data  | JSON/API      |
| CS Platform (Gainsight)  | Health scores, CTA triggers       | JSON/API      |
| Legal                    | Contract amendment templates      | DOCX/PDF      |
| Finance (CFO team)       | Price escalation authority matrix | Spreadsheet   |
| expansion_play-builder   | Expansion context for multi-year  | YAML          |

## Produces For
| Consumer / Builder       | What                              | Format        |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| CSM (Customer Success)   | Renewal stage tasks, email templates| Markdown    |
| RevOps                   | GRR model, renewal forecast       | YAML/CSV      |
| CRM (Salesforce)         | Renewal Opportunity stage updates | JSON/API      |
| Gainsight                | CTA configuration blueprints      | YAML/JSON     |
| Legal                    | Contract amendment checklist      | Markdown      |
| CFO / Finance            | GRR scenario report               | CSV/Dashboard |

## Boundary
Does NOT handle expansion plays (expansion_play) -- renewal protects existing ARR, expansion grows it. Does NOT handle churn intervention (churn_prevention_playbook) -- workflows for accounts with health score <40 belong there. Legal enforcement of contract terms and compliance litigation are handled by the Legal team, not this builder.
