## Architectural Position
renewal_workflow serves as the GRR protection engine within CEX P12 orchestration layer, automating the contract lifecycle from 90-day pre-renewal through close. It bridges Salesforce (opportunity management), Gainsight (health scoring and CTA automation), and Legal (contract amendment governance), enforcing stage-gated accountability and price-increase compliance across the renewal motion used by Salesforce, HubSpot, and Gainsight-native CS organizations.
