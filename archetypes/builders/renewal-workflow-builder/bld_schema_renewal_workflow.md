## ID Pattern
^p12_rw_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+\.yaml$

## Body Structure
1. **Renewal Stage Map** -- 90/60/30-day stages with owners, tasks, automation triggers
2. **Price Increase Playbook** -- announcement timing, percentage, objection responses, discount authority
3. **Multi-Year Offer** -- discount structure, approval matrix, commitment incentives
4. **Escalation Path** -- CSM -> Manager -> VP CS triggers and health score thresholds
5. **Auto-Renewal Compliance** -- notice periods by jurisdiction, opt-out process, audit trail
6. **GRR Model** -- full renewal, contraction, and churn scenarios with ARR impact

## Constraints
- All required fields must be present and valid.
- id must match regex pattern exactly.
- renewal_stage must be one of: 90_day, 60_day, 30_day, closed_won, closed_lost.
- days_to_renewal must be a positive integer.
- GRR_impact must be one of: full, contraction_{pct} (e.g., contraction_15), churn.
- Escalation path must define health score threshold for each escalation level.
- Auto-renewal notices must specify jurisdiction (US state, EU, APAC -- not generic).
