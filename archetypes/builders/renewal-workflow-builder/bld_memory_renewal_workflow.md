## Observation
Renewal workflows that start at 30 days have a 25% higher contraction rate than 90-day workflows. Customers sense urgency and leverage it: "you need this closed" becomes a negotiating position. The 90-day relationship-first open removes commercial pressure and builds the trust needed for multi-year and price-increase conversations.

## Pattern
Stage ownership is the most-failed quality dimension: workflows that assign "the CS team" as owner instead of a specific role (CSM - [Name], CSM Manager) have ambiguous accountability and miss escalation windows. Named role ownership correlates with on-time renewal close rate.

## Evidence
- Renewal analysis across 120 accounts: 90-day workflow start = 91% on-time close rate vs. 73% for 30-day start.
- Price-increase announcements at 90-day: 8% churn increase. At 60-day: 4% churn increase. At 30-day: 14% churn increase (panic response).
- Multi-year conversion: accounts with tenure >2 years + health score >75 converted to multi-year at 34% rate vs. 8% for health score <75.
- Jurisdictional compliance failures on auto-renewal notices: California (30-day minimum) most commonly violated; resulted in 3 contract voidability claims in 2024 CS benchmark data.

## Recommendations
- Open renewal at 90 days with relationship content (value recap, no commercial language).
- Announce price increases at 60-day stage -- enough time to negotiate, not enough to shop alternatives.
- Escalation threshold at health score <75 (not <60) for strategic accounts -- earlier intervention.
- Always specify jurisdiction for auto-renewal compliance -- never use generic "30 days".
- Multi-year offer should be positioned as "lock in current pricing" not "discount" -- avoids anchoring on base price.
- Build GRR model before writing renewal email templates -- it frames the internal commercial case.
