Automation Triggers:
  - Gainsight CTA: "Renewal 90 Days" fires when days_to_renewal = 90

  - Send formal renewal proposal with price-increase notice
  - Present multi-year incentive if flagged ({{multi_year_discount}}% for 2yr)
  - Run QBR or business review to reinforce value
  - Negotiate contract terms and discount authority check
Automation Triggers:
  - Gainsight CTA: "Renewal 60 Days" fires when days_to_renewal = 60
  - Salesforce Opportunity Stage: set to "Renewal Proposed"
  - Alert: no response in 7 days -> escalate to {{escalation_owner_2}}

## 30-Day Stage (Owner: {{owner_30}})
Tasks:
  - Final close call with economic buyer
  - Legal redlines and contract amendment review
  - Confirm auto-renewal opt-out window compliance
