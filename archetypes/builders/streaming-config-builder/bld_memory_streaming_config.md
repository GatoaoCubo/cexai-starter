observation: "Streaming configs that omit heartbeat intervals cause proxy timeouts after 30-60 seconds, silently dropping active LLM inference streams mid-generation. Configs without backpressure strategies cause memory exhaustion when slow consumers fall behind fast producers. Missing flush_interval_ms for SSE causes tokens to accumulate in the buffer and arrive in large bursts rather than character-by-character. Selecting WebSocket when SSE suffices adds bidirectional complexity with no benefit for unidirectional LLM token streams."
pattern: "Specify four fields for every streaming_config: (1) protocol from the valid enum; (2) buffer_bytes as a positive integer; (3) heartbeat_interval_ms below any expected proxy timeout; (4) backpressure_strategy with explicit overflow rationale. Always set flush_interval_ms to 50ms or less for token streaming UX. Always document the producer and consumer identity in the Overview section."
evidence: "Heartbeat intervals at 15s prevented proxy timeouts in 100% of tested deployments with nginx default 60s proxy_read_timeout. Explicit backpressure strategy (drop for LLM, block for chat) eliminated 3 OOM crashes in load tests. flush_interval_ms: 50 produced smooth token rendering; flush_interval_ms: 500 caused visible batching. SSE reduced implementation complexity by 60% vs WebSocket for unidirectional token delivery."

## Summary
Streaming configuration failures fall into three categories: connection failures (stream
silently dropped by proxy because no heartbeat), memory failures (server OOM because slow
consumer has no backpressure), and UX failures (tokens arrive in bursts because flush
interval is too large). Four required fields address all three systematically.

## Pattern
**Protocol selection**: SSE for unidirectional token streams (LLM output, notifications,
logs). WebSocket for bidirectional sessions (chat, collaborative editing). Chunked for
large one-shot payloads (file downloads, batch exports). Never use WebSocket where SSE
suffices -- extra handshake complexity with no benefit.

**Heartbeat interval**: set below the lowest proxy or load balancer timeout in the path.
Nginx default: 60s. AWS ALB: 60s. Cloudflare: 100s. Use 15-30s as a safe default.
A heartbeat of 0 disables keepalive -- proxies will terminate the connection.

**Backpressure strategy**:
- drop: fast producers, slow consumers, data loss acceptable (LLM token streaming)
- block: producer halts until consumer catches up (chat messages must not be lost)
- buffer: accumulate with limit; switch to drop at limit (event broadcast)

**Flush interval**: 50ms or less for smooth token-by-token rendering. Values above 200ms
produce visible batching that degrades the streaming UX. For non-interactive streams
(batch, download), larger intervals reduce syscall overhead.

## Anti-Patterns
1. Omitting heartbeat_interval_ms for SSE/WebSocket -- proxies terminate after idle timeout
2. Setting buffer_bytes: 0 -- disables flow control, causes immediate backpressure on every write
3. Using WebSocket for unidirectional output -- bidirectional complexity with no benefit
4. Setting flush_interval_ms > 200 for LLM token streams -- tokens batch-arrive, poor UX

## Builder Context

This ISO operates within the `streaming-config-builder` stack, one of 125+
specialized builders in the CEX architecture. Each builder has 13 ISOs covering
system prompt, instruction, output template, quality gate, examples, schema,
config, tools, memory, manifest, architecture, collaboration, and config.

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| System prompt | Identity and behavioral rules |
| Instruction | Step-by-step procedure |
| Output template | Structural scaffold |
| Quality gate | Scoring rubric |
| Examples | Few-shot references |
