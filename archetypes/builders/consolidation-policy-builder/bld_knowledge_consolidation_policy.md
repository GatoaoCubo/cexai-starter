## Domain Overview

Memory consolidation in LLM agents governs *when and how* memories move between tiers
(working -> episodic -> semantic), get evicted, merged, or archived. Unlike OS garbage
collection or hardware memory compaction, agent memory consolidation is about *information
value*: should this interaction be remembered? At what granularity? For how long?

MemGPT/Letta (Packer 2023) introduced the consolidation pipeline as an explicit agent
function: after each conversation, a background job scores episodic entries, promotes
high-value facts to semantic memory, and archives or deletes low-value entries. This
"sleep-time consolidation" mirrors neuroscience models of memory offline replay.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Definition | Source |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Working -> Episodic Promotion | Saving in-context interaction to episodic store after session ends | MemGPT/Letta |
| Episodic -> Semantic Promotion | Extracting durable facts from interaction history into semantic store | MemGPT consolidation pipeline |
| Importance Scoring | Assigning a retention priority to each memory unit (0-1 float) | mem0 (2024) |
| Sleep-Time Consolidation | Background job runs when agent is idle to consolidate memories | MemGPT/Letta (Packer 2023) |
| Replay-Based Memory | Re-processing old episodic entries to extract missed semantic facts | Episodic memory research |
| LRU Eviction | Remove least recently accessed memories when storage budget exceeded | Cache theory |
| LFU Eviction | Remove least frequently accessed memories | Cache theory |
| TTL (Time-To-Live) | Fixed expiry time per memory unit (e.g., 90 days) | Standard practice |
| Memory Merging | Deduplicating similar episodic entries into a single canonical record | Zep (2024) |
| Forgetting Curve | Exponential decay of memory importance over time without reinforcement | Ebbinghaus (1885) |
| Retention Policy | Rule set defining what to keep, for how long, and under what conditions | Enterprise compliance |

## Consolidation Pipeline (MemGPT Model)

```
[Session ends]
     |
     v
[Episodic buffer] -- (async job triggered)
     |
     +-- Score each entry (recency + relevance + user_feedback)
     |
     +-- High score (>0.7) --> Promote to semantic memory
     |       |
     |       +-- Deduplicate against existing semantic entries
     |       +-- Merge if similarity > 0.92
     |       +-- Write new entity/fact to graph or KV store
     |
     +-- Medium score (0.3-0.7) --> Archive to cold storage
     |
     +-- Low score (<0.3) --> Delete (or soft-delete for compliance)
```

## Eviction Strategies

| Strategy | Trigger | Best For |
|----------|---------|---------|
| TTL | Age > N days | Time-sensitive facts, compliance |
| LRU | Storage > budget, remove oldest accessed | General episodic memory |
| LFU | Storage > budget, remove least queried | Semantic entity store |
| Importance threshold | Importance < floor (e.g., 0.3) | Mixed TTL + value |
| Generational | N interactions old, no semantic promotion | Conversation logs |

## Commercial Tier Differentiation

| Feature | Free | PRO | ENTERPRISE |
|---------|------|-----|------------|
| Consolidation | None | Basic TTL (90 days) | Configurable + compliance |
| Episodic retention | None | 90 days | Custom (1y / indefinite) |
| Semantic promotion | None | Auto (LLM-driven) | Scheduled + audited |
| Sleep-time consolidation | None | On session end | Continuous + scheduled |
| Retention policy | N/A | Fixed | Custom rules + data residency |
| Audit trail | None | Read | Write + export + GDPR |
| Merge/dedup | None | Similarity-based | LLM-driven + manual review |

## Enterprise Compliance Considerations

- GDPR Art. 17 (right to erasure): consolidation must support hard-delete, not just archive
- HIPAA: retention period for health-related agent memories may be governed by law
- Data residency: consolidation jobs must not transfer memories across regions
- Audit trail: every promotion/eviction event should be logged with timestamp + reason

## Common Patterns

1. **Session-end consolidation**: trigger pipeline after every conversation ends.
2. **Importance-gated promotion**: only promote episodic entries with score > threshold.
3. **Merge-before-write**: check semantic memory for duplicates before adding new facts.
4. **Cold archival**: TTL-expired entries move to cold storage before hard delete.
5. **Replay sweep**: periodic re-processing of episodic archive for missed semantic facts.

## Pitfalls

- Consolidating everything wastes semantic memory with low-signal facts.
- No deduplication creates semantic memory bloat with conflicting versions of the same fact.
- Ignoring compliance requirements exposes the system to data retention violations.
- Synchronous consolidation blocks agent response time; always run async.
- No audit trail makes GDPR erasure requests impossible to verify.
