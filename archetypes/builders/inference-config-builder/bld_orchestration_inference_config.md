# Collaboration: inference-config-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer: "how to serve this model in production?"
I do not train models. I do not configure tokenizers.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Model Deployment Stack"
```
1. tokenizer-config-builder -> "tokenizer for input processing"
2. inference-config-builder -> "serving framework and optimization"
3. rate-limit-config-builder -> "API rate limiting"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: model ID, hardware specs, latency targets, throughput requirements
### I Produce
- inference_config artifact (.md with YAML frontmatter)
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score)
## Builders I Depend On
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| tokenizer-config-builder | Tokenizer config needed for input processing |
| distillation-config-builder | Distilled model may require specific serving config |
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| rate-limit-config-builder | Needs serving capacity for rate limit calculation |
## Integration Points
| Point | Direction | Protocol |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| F8 COLLABORATE | outbound | signal_writer.write_signal() |
| F3 INJECT | inbound | Receives upstream artifacts via handoff |
| model_provider | upstream | Must exist before inference config production |
| thinking_config | upstream | Must exist before inference config production |
| streaming_config | upstream | Must exist before inference config production |
## Dependencies
| Dependency | Required | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| model_provider | yes | Upstream artifact for inference config |
| thinking_config | yes | Upstream artifact for inference config |
| streaming_config | yes | Upstream artifact for inference config |
