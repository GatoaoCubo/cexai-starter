# Memory: context-file-builder

## Summary
Context files are the CEX equivalent of CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md: ambient project-scoped
instructions that shape every agent turn without repeating in every prompt. The critical
production lesson is scope misclassification: authors default to workspace scope when nucleus
scope would be correct, polluting broader context with narrow conventions. The second lesson
is injection_point economics: every_turn is used too liberally when session_start is sufficient,
doubling token cost for stable rules that never change mid-session.

## Pattern
1. Default injection_point to session_start unless rules must apply every turn -- session_start pays once
2. Classify scope conservatively: only go as broad as the rule actually applies
3. Build inheritance_chain from actual parent IDs -- never reference non-existent IDs
4. Write child context_files as pure overrides: if rule exists in parent, do not repeat it
5. Cap nucleus scope max_bytes at 4096 and session scope at 2048 -- enforce byte discipline early
6. Tag every context_file with hermes_origin -- provenance chain must be complete

## Anti-Pattern
1. Scope too broad: repo-specific conventions put in global scope = pollutes all repos
2. every_turn injection for stable rules = 10-30x token cost for zero behavioral gain
3. Duplicating parent rules in child = drift risk when parent updates but child was not
4. Missing inheritance_chain entry = child re-specifies rules that parent already covers
5. Facts in body = knowledge_cards and context_files get confused; retrieval breaks
6. Template vars `{{var}}` in static context_file = harness injects raw var text into context
7. scope: session + injection: every_turn = most expensive combination; rare legitimate use
8. Omitting max_bytes = harness uses system default which may truncate large files silently

## Context
Context files sit at the F3 INJECT stage of 8F. They load after the agent's identity
(system_prompt at F2 BECOME) and before task execution (action_prompt). The inheritance
model means a global_context.md rule survives even if workspace or nucleus contexts are
absent -- authoring root context_files first is the most resilient strategy.

In the kind assimilation: CLAUDE.md = workspace context_file; AGENTS.md = nucleus/workspace
context_file focused on multi-agent coordination instructions. CEX elevates both to the same
schema with explicit scope control.

## Impact
Session_start injection vs every_turn: ~30x token cost reduction for stable rules
(tested in N03 build context injection). Scope narrowing from workspace to nucleus:
~60% reduction in context_file size (nucleus-only rules excluded from workspace).
Child-extends-parent inheritance: ~40% rule duplication reduction in multi-scope setups.

## Reproducibility
For reliable context_file production:
(1) classify scope -- use narrowest applicable
(2) select injection_point -- session_start unless compliance-critical
(3) build inheritance_chain -- list all broader-scope parents
(4) write instructions only -- no facts, no vars
(5) stay within byte budget -- narrower scope = smaller budget
(6) set quality: null -- never self-score
(7) validate against H01-H08 HARD gates
