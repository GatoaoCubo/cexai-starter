## Context
The context-file-builder produces a `context_file` artifact -- a static, project-scoped instruction
pattern: standing behavioral rules for a scope that shape every agent turn without redefining identity.

**Critical distinction**: a context_file is INSTRUCTIONS (behavioral rules, standing constraints) not
FACTS (knowledge_card), not IDENTITY (system_prompt), not PARAMETERIZED (prompt_template), not
PROCEDURAL RECIPE (instruction kind). Confusing these types produces broken injection behavior.

**Input contract**:
- `scope_domain`: the target workspace, nucleus, session, or global context
- `scope_type`: enum -- `workspace` | `nucleus` | `session` | `global`
- `injection_point`: enum -- `session_start` | `every_turn` | `f3_inject`
- `parent_context_files`: list of parent IDs (empty = root)
- `priority`: integer (0 = highest authority)
- `applies_to_nuclei`: `[all]` or list of nucleus IDs
- `rules`: list of standing behavioral rules for this scope (min 3)

**Output contract**: a single `context_file` artifact with 13 required frontmatter fields and
instruction-only body sections stored at the appropriate pillar path.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Classify Scope and Injection Strategy
**Action**: Determine correct scope and injection_point from inputs.
```
scope_map = {
 "all sessions all nuclei": "global",
 "all nuclei one project": "workspace",
 "one nucleus all sessions": "nucleus",
 "current session only": "session"
}
scope = scope_map[derived_coverage]

injection_map = {
 "stable rules loaded once": "session_start", -- cheapest, most common
 "compliance-critical per turn": "every_turn", -- expensive, use sparingly
 "on-demand via 8F pipeline": "f3_inject" -- zero cost until called
}
injection_point = injection_map[use_case_urgency]
```
Verifiable exit: scope and injection_point are both set with justification.

### Phase 2: Build Inheritance Chain
**Action**: Identify parent context_files this artifact inherits from.
```
IF scope == "global":
 inheritance_chain = # root; nothing to inherit
ELIF scope == "workspace":
 inheritance_chain = [global_ctx_id] IF global exists ELSE 
ELIF scope == "nucleus":
 inheritance_chain = [workspace_ctx_id, global_ctx_id] filtered to existing
ELIF scope == "session":
 inheritance_chain = [nucleus_ctx_id, workspace_ctx_id, global_ctx_id] filtered to existing

FOR each parent_id in inheritance_chain:
 ASSERT parent_id is a valid existing context_file id
 ASSERT parent_id scope is broader than this context_file's scope
```
Child extends parent. Override only what differs; never duplicate parent rules.
Verifiable exit: inheritance_chain contains valid parent IDs or is empty.

### Phase 3: Author Instruction Body
**Action**: Write static behavioral rules for this scope.
```
FOR each rule_domain in derived_rule_set:
 section = "## " + rule_domain_title
 FOR each rule in rule_domain:
 ASSERT rule is an instruction (behavioral) NOT a fact (knowledge)
 ASSERT rule has no "{{vars}}" placeholders
 ASSERT rule is actionable and verifiable
 body += section + rule_list

ASSERT len(all_rules) >= 3
ASSERT body_bytes <= max_bytes
ASSERT no_facts_in_body (redirect facts to knowledge_card)
ASSERT no_template_vars (redirect to prompt_template)
```
Verifiable exit: body has >= 1 section, >= 3 rules, all instructions, <= max_bytes.

### Phase 4: Compose context_file Frontmatter
**Action**: Assemble all resolved values into the 13-field YAML structure.
Required fields in order:
1. `id` -- `ctx_`{{scope_slug}} -- regex: `^ctx_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$`
2. `kind` -- `context_file`
3. `pillar` -- `P03`
4. `title` -- human-readable scope description
5. `scope` -- workspace | nucleus | session | global
6. `injection_point` -- session_start | every_turn | f3_inject
7. `inheritance_chain` -- list of parent IDs (may be empty)
8. `max_bytes` -- integer (default 8192)
9. `priority` -- 0 = most authoritative
10. `applies_to_nuclei` -- [all] or explicit list
11. `version` -- "1.0.0"
12. `quality` -- null (invariant -- never self-score)
13. `tags` -- list >= 3; include scope name and `hermes_origin`

Verifiable exit: YAML parses cleanly; all 13 fields present; quality is null.

### Phase 5: Validate Against Quality Gates
**Action**: Run HARD gates before emitting; log SOFT gates as warnings.
```
HARD gates (all must pass):
 H01: Frontmatter parses as valid YAML -- no syntax errors
 H02: id matches regex ^ctx_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$
 H03: id equals filename stem
 H04: kind is exactly "context_file"
 H05: quality is null
 H06: scope is one of: workspace, nucleus, session, global
 H07: injection_point is one of: session_start, every_turn, f3_inject
 H08: body contains at least one ## section with >= 3 rule items

SOFT gates (warnings):
 S01: body_bytes <= max_bytes
 S02: no {{vars}} in body
 S03: no facts in body (no "X is defined as", no citations)
 S04: inheritance_chain references valid existing context_file IDs
 S05: tags include scope name
  S06: tags include "hermes_origin"
 S07: density_score field present
```
Verifiable exit: all HARD gates pass; SOFT gate failures logged with remediation.
