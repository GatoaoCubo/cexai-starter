# Collaboration: output-validator-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "what are the parameters and constraints for this output validator?"
I specify output validator configurations so agents and pipelines can use them.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Validation Pipeline"
```
  1. constraint-spec-builder -> decode constraint
  2. output-validator-builder -> post-gen validation
  3. quality-gate-builder -> scoring
```
### Crew: "Output Quality"
```
  1. output-validator-builder -> structural validation
  2. formatter-builder -> output formatting
  3. parser-builder -> output extraction
```

## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
1. seeds: output validator purpose, target system, constraints
2. optional: specific parameter values, upstream artifact references
### I Produce
1. output_validator artifact (.md + .yaml frontmatter)
2. committed to: `cex/P05_output/examples/p05_oval_{name}.md`
### I Signal
1. signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
2. if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons
