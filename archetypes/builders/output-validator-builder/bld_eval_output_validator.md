## Quality Gate

# Gate: output_validator
## Definition
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| metric | output_validator artifact quality score |
| threshold | 7.0 (publish >= 8.0, golden >= 9.5) |
| operator | weighted_sum |
| scope | all artifacts with `kind: output_validator` |
## HARD Gates
All must pass (AND logic). Any single failure = REJECT.
| ID | Check | Fail Condition |
|---|---|---|
| H01 | Frontmatter parses as valid YAML | Parse error on frontmatter block |
| H02 | ID matches `^p05_oval_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$` | ID contains uppercase, spaces, or invalid chars |
| H03 | ID equals filename stem | id field != filename without extension |
| H04 | Kind equals literal `output_validator` | Any other kind value |
| H05 | Quality field is null | Any non-null value |
| H06 | All required fields present | Missing quality, tags, tldr or other required fields |
| H07 | All required body sections present | Missing ## Overview or ## Checks or ## Failure Actions or ## Integration |
| H08 | Body <= 2048 bytes | Body exceeds size limit |
## SOFT Scoring
Weights sum to 100%.
| Dimension | Weight | Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| Parameter completeness | 1.0 | All parameters have concrete values (no placeholders) |
| Rationale quality | 1.0 | Each parameter value has clear rationale |
| Pattern selection | 1.0 | Correct pattern chosen for the use case |
| Boundary clarity | 1.0 | Explicitly states what this IS and IS NOT |
| Integration mapping | 0.5 | Upstream and downstream connections documented |
| Density | 1.0 | Information density >= 0.85, no filler content |
| Tags quality | 0.5 | Tags >= 3, includes "output_validator", relevant to content |
| Tldr quality | 0.5 | Tldr <= 160 chars, dense, accurate summary |
| Domain specificity | 1.0 | Parameters and values specific to declared domain |
| Testability | 0.5 | Configuration can be validated with known inputs |
## Actions
| Score | Tier | Action |
|---|---|---|
| >= 9.5 | Golden | Publish to pool as golden reference |
| >= 8.0 | Publish | Publish to pool, add to routing index |
| >= 7.0 | Review | Flag for improvement before publish |
| < 7.0 | Reject | Return to author with specific gate failures |

## Examples

# Examples: output-validator-builder
## Golden Example
INPUT: "Create output validator for product listing JSON"
OUTPUT:
```yaml
id: p05_oval_product_listing
kind: output_validator
pillar: P05
version: "1.0.0"
created: "2026-03-29"
updated: "2026-03-29"
author: "builder_agent"
name: "Product Listing JSON Validator"
quality: null
tags: [output_validator, P05, output]
tldr: "Product Listing JSON Validator — production-ready output_validator configuration"
```
## Overview
Post-generation validator for product listing JSON output.
Runs 4 checks in sequence; on failure, injects error context and retries up to 2 times.

## Checks
| ID | Check | Type | Severity | Description |
|----|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| C01 | schema_valid | json_schema | HARD | Output matches product listing Pydantic model |
| C02 | price_positive | assertion | HARD | price > 0 and price < 999999 |
| C03 | title_length | range | SOFT | 10 <= len(title) <= 200 characters |
| C04 | no_prohibited_claims | regex_deny | HARD | No health claims, no superlatives without evidence |
Execution order: C01 -> C02 -> C04 -> C03 (HARD gates first, SOFT last).
Short-circuit: first HARD failure triggers on_fail immediately.

## Failure Actions
| Action | When | Behavior |
|--------|------|----------|
| fix_and_retry | HARD gate fails, retries < 2 | Inject error + failed check into prompt, regenerate |
| warn | SOFT gate fails | Log warning, pass output with quality penalty |
| reject | HARD gate fails after 2 retries | Return error object with failure details |
Fix prompt template: "Previous output failed validation: {error}. Fix the {field} field to satisfy: {check_description}. Output ONLY the corrected JSON."
Max retries: 2. Backoff: none (immediate retry).

## Integration
- Input: raw LLM output string (expected JSON)
- Output: validated object or error report
- Upstream: p03_constraint_json_product (decode-time constraint)
- Downstream: p11_qg_product_listing (quality scoring)
WHY THIS IS GOLDEN:
- quality: null (H05 pass)
- id matches p05_oval_ pattern (H02 pass)
- kind: output_validator (H04 pass)
- All required fields present (H06 pass)

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
