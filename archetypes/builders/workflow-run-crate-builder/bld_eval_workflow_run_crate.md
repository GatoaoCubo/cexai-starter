## Quality Gate

## Definition
| Metric | Threshold | Operator | Scope |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| RO-Crate 1.2 Workflow Run Crate compliance | 100% | equals | All HARD gates |

## HARD Gates
| ID  | Check | Fail Condition |
|-----|-------|----------------|
| H01 | YAML frontmatter valid | Invalid YAML syntax or missing fields |
| H02 | ID matches pattern ^p10_wrc_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+\.md$ | ID format mismatch |
| H03 | kind field is "workflow_run_crate" | Kind field incorrect or missing |
| H04 | @context includes RO-Crate 1.2 context URL | Missing or wrong context |
| H05 | CreateAction entity present with instrument, object, result, agent | Missing or incomplete provenance graph |
| H06 | agent_orcid is valid ORCID URL format | Non-ORCID or local IRI |
| H07 | At least one input Dataset with sha256 or md5 | Missing checksum on input datasets |

## SOFT Scoring
| Dim | Dimension | Weight | Scoring Guide |
|-----|-----------|--------|---------------|
| D01 | CreateAction completeness (instrument, object, result, agent, startTime, endTime) | 0.30 | All present = 1.0, partial = 0.5, missing critical = 0 |
| D02 | Dataset coverage (all inputs + outputs have checksums and encodingFormat) | 0.25 | Complete = 1.0, partial = 0.5, absent = 0 |
| D03 | Author attribution (ORCID Person entity with name and affiliation) | 0.20 | Full ORCID record = 1.0, ORCID only = 0.7, absent = 0 |
| D04 | Software environment (SoftwareApplication entities for workflow tools) | 0.15 | All tools documented = 1.0, partial = 0.5, absent = 0 |
| D05 | Domain keyword density (RO-Crate, workflow-run, provenance-graph, ORCID, Galaxy, input-dataset, output-dataset) | 0.10 | 7+ keywords = 1.0, 5-6 = 0.7, <5 = 0.3 |

## Actions
| Score | Action |

| GOLDEN | >=9.5 | Auto-publish with no review |
| PUBLISH | >=8.0 | Auto-publish after validation |
| REVIEW  | >=7.0 | Require manual review |
| REJECT  | <7.0  | Reject and flag for correction |

## Anti-Example 1: Missing CreateAction
```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.2/context"],
  "@graph": [
    {"@type": "Dataset", "@id": "./", "name": "My Workflow Run"},
    {"@type": "File", "@id": "workflow.ga"}
  ]
}
```
**Why it fails**: No CreateAction entity. The CreateAction is the provenance graph spine -- it links the workflow (instrument) to inputs (object) and outputs (result) with the executing researcher (agent/ORCID). Without it, the crate cannot be used for reproducibility or provenance verification.

## Anti-Example 2: Non-ORCID Person ID
```json
{
  "@type": "Person",
  "@id": "author",
  "name": "J. Lee"
}
```
**Why it fails**: Person @id must be a full ORCID URL. Local IRI "author" is not resolvable and breaks FAIR Signposting.
