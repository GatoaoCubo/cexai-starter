## Architectural Position
workflow_run_crate occupies the P10 scientific provenance sublayer. It is the execution-time complement to workflow-builder (P12 workflow definition). The data flow is: workflow-builder defines the workflow -> nucleus executes it -> workflow_run_crate packages the execution provenance. vc_credential can be linked from CreateAction.agent for cryptographic researcher identity. Downstream consumers: WorkflowHub.eu, Zenodo, institutional research data repositories, Galaxy History export format.
