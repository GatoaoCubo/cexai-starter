## Observation
Most workflow provenance records use ad-hoc formats (log files, README.txt, spreadsheets). RO-Crate Workflow Run Crate standardizes this into a machine-readable, FAIR-compliant JSON-LD package. The most common error: generating a crate without the CreateAction entity, which removes the provenance graph spine entirely.

## Pattern
Always start with CreateAction: identify the workflow (instrument), inputs (object array), outputs (result array), and researcher (agent ORCID). Build Dataset entities around this spine. The crate is a star graph with CreateAction at center.

## Evidence
Galaxy EuroScienceGateway project (Horizon Europe, ended Aug 2025) produced 3000+ Workflow Run Crates. WorkflowHub.eu hosts 1200+ workflows with RO-Crate metadata. RO-Crate 1.2 stable spec released 2025. Workflow Run Crate profile now stable (was draft in 1.1 era).

## Recommendations
- Always build CreateAction first (it defines the provenance graph structure).
- Use ORCID URLs as Person @id -- never local IDs.
- Include sha256 checksums for all input/output datasets.
- Use RO-Crate 1.2 context URL (not 1.1 -- breaking context change).
- For Galaxy runs: use Galaxy's built-in RO-Crate export (History -> Export as RO-Crate) as baseline.
- For multi-step workflows: nest CreateAction entities (parent run -> step runs).
- Test validation with rocrate-py validate command before submission to WorkflowHub.
