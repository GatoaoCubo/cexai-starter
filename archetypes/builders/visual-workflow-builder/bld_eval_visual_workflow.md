## Quality Gate

## Definition
| metric          | threshold | operator | scope        |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Config Validity | 100%      | >=       | per workflow |

## HARD Gates
| ID        | Check                     | Fail Condition                                      |
|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| H01       | YAML frontmatter valid    | Invalid YAML syntax or missing required fields      |
| H02       | ID matches pattern        | ID does not match ^p12_vw_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+.md$      |
| H03       | kind field matches        | kind != 'visual_workflow'                           |
| H04       | Required fields present   | Missing 'name' or 'description' in metadata         |
| H05       | Workflow steps valid      | Invalid step type or missing required attributes    |
| H06       | Tool compatibility        | Unsupported tool referenced in workflow             |
| H07       | UI responsiveness         | Workflow editor fails to render on mobile devices   |

## SOFT Scoring

## Examples

## Golden Example
```markdown
---
kind: visual_workflow
name: CustomerOnboardingProcess
description: End-to-end customer onboarding workflow using Apache NiFi
---

**Tool**: Apache NiFi  
**Workflow Steps**:
1. **GetFile** - Ingest CSV data from SFTP server
2. **ConvertRecord** - Parse CSV to JSON using Avro schema
3. **ExecuteSQL** - Validate customer data against PostgreSQL database
4. **PutDatabase** - Insert validated records into MongoDB cluster
5. **EmailProcessor** - Send confirmation email via SendGrid API
```

## Anti-Example 1: Code-Defined Workflow
```markdown
---
kind: visual_workflow
name: FraudDetectionPipeline
description: Fraud detection using Apache Airflow
---

**Tool**: Apache Airflow  
**Workflow Steps**:
- [PythonOperator] Load data from S3
- [BashOperator] Run Spark job on EMR
- [EmailOperator] Notify results via SMTP
```
## Why it fails
Apache Airflow is a code-defined workflow system, not a visual editor. The artifact violates the boundary by using a tool that requires code configuration rather than GUI-based drag-and-drop interface.

## Anti-Example 2: DAG-Based Workflow
```markdown
---
kind: visual_workflow
name: DataProcessingPipeline
description: ETL process using Apache Luigi
---

**Tool**: Apache Luigi  
**Workflow Steps**:
- Task1: Extract data from MySQL
- Task2: Transform data with Pandas
- Task3: Load to Redshift
```
## Why it fails
Apache Luigi is a DAG-based system that requires code configuration. The artifact incorrectly categorizes a directed acyclic graph (DAG) workflow as a visual workflow, which is a fundamentally different paradigm.

### H_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (HARD)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (min 3 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream or sibling reference
- Gate: REJECT if < 3 entries (auto-populated by cex_wikilink.py at F6.5)

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
