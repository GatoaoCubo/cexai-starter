## Phase 1: RESEARCH  
1. Analyze existing GUI workflow tools for feature parity  
2. Identify user interaction patterns for drag-and-drop node placement  
3. Map workflow elements (tasks, triggers, conditions) to visual components  
4. Study UI/UX principles for hierarchical workflow visualization  
5. Evaluate technical constraints (browser compatibility, performance)  
6. Document requirements for real-time validation and error highlighting  

## Phase 2: COMPOSE  
1. Define node schema using bld_schema_visual_workflow.md for data model alignment  
2. Specify node types (trigger, action, condition, output) with input/output ports  
3. Define edge schema: connection type, data type, cardinality  
4. Map workflow DSL to visual representation (Mermaid-compatible node/edge schema)  
5. Apply bld_output_template_visual_workflow.md for final artifact structure  
6. Integrate validation rules from bld_schema_visual_workflow.md into workflow engine  
7. Add persistence layer: serialize/deserialize workflow as JSON  
8. Document visual layout conventions: left-to-right flow, color-coded node types  
9. Finalize artifact with versioning and export capabilities  

## Phase 3: VALIDATE  
[ ] Frontmatter complete and valid YAML  
[ ] Node schema complete with all required fields  
[ ] Edge connections validated (no orphaned nodes)  
[ ] Conforms to bld_output_template_visual_workflow.md structure  
[ ] Compatible with at least one DSL standard (Mermaid, LangGraph, n8n)
