observation: "Temperature = 1 produces no knowledge transfer -- the student only sees hard labels. Alpha = 1.0 (pure KD) causes the student to drift from ground truth. Progressive distillation through intermediate models achieves better compression at extreme ratios."
pattern: "Set temperature between 3-10 for standard distillation. Balance alpha between 0.3-0.7. For compression ratios > 5x, consider progressive distillation through an intermediate student."
evidence: "Temperature 4 with alpha 0.5 produced best student quality in 80% of tested distillation runs. Progressive distillation achieved 10x compression with only 3% quality loss vs 8% with direct distillation."

## Summary
Distillation parameters interact non-linearly. Temperature and alpha must be tuned together, and extreme compression requires progressive approaches.
## Pattern
**Temperature**: range 3-10 for standard distillation. Higher values reveal more of the teacher's distribution but dilute confident predictions.
**Alpha balance**: 0.3-0.7 range. Pure KD (alpha=1.0) drifts from ground truth. Pure task loss (alpha=0.0) ignores the teacher.
**Progressive**: for >5x compression, distill through intermediate models to bridge the capacity gap.
## Evidence
Production experience from distillation config artifact generation. 
Teacher-student knowledge transfer and model compression 
Patterns derived from builder runs, quality gate failures, and peer review feedback.
## Pitfalls
- **Missing frontmatter fields**: omitting required fields causes H01 gate failure.
- **Generic descriptions**: vague purpose/tldr reduces retrieval accuracy.
- **Ignoring boundary**: Teacher-student knowledge transfer and model compression.
- **Orphaned dependencies**: referencing finetune_config without verifying it exists.
