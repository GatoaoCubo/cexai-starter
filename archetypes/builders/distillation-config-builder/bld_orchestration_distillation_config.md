# Collaboration: distillation-config-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer: "how to compress this teacher into a smaller student?"
I do not generate training data. I do not define model architecture.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Model Compression Pipeline"
```
1. synthetic-data-config-builder -> "training data generation"
2. distillation-config-builder -> "teacher-student training config"
3. eval-metric-builder -> "quality metrics for distilled model"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: teacher model, compression target, quality budget
### I Produce
- distillation_config artifact (.md with YAML frontmatter)
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score)
## Builders I Depend On
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| synthetic-data-config-builder | May provide training data for distillation |
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| eval-metric-builder | Needs distillation quality targets for evaluation |
| inference-config-builder | Configures serving for distilled student model |
## Integration Points
| Point | Direction | Protocol |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| F8 COLLABORATE | outbound | signal_writer.write_signal() |
| F3 INJECT | inbound | Receives upstream artifacts via handoff |
| finetune_config | upstream | Must exist before distillation config production |
| quantization_config | upstream | Must exist before distillation config production |
| model_card | upstream | Must exist before distillation config production |
## Dependencies
| Dependency | Required | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| finetune_config | yes | Upstream artifact for distillation config |
| quantization_config | yes | Upstream artifact for distillation config |
| model_card | yes | Upstream artifact for distillation config |
