## Domain Overview

This ISO selects a reasoning strategy (e.g. chain-of-thought) and the conditions under which it applies.
Reasoning_strategy artifacts structure how AI systems process information to derive conclusions, often used in complex domains like healthcare diagnostics, legal analysis, and autonomous systems. These strategies define the logical flow, heuristics, and constraints guiding inference engines, ensuring alignment with domain-specific rules and objectives. They differ from generic prompt techniques by embedding domain knowledge into the reasoning process, enabling systems to handle ambiguity, prioritize evidence, and validate outputs through formal or semi-formal methods.

Industries leverage reasoning strategies to enhance transparency, reduce errors, and comply with regulations. For example, in finance, strategies may enforce risk-assessment hierarchies, while in law, they might encode precedent-based argumentation. Effective strategies balance computational efficiency with accuracy, often integrating knowledge graphs, rule-based systems, or probabilistic models.

## Industry Standards
- ISO/IEC 23894: AI Trustworthiness Framework
- IBM’s SOAR (Situation, Option, Action, Result) for decision modeling
- Google’s PaLM reasoning benchmarks
- ACL 2023 guidelines on structured inference in NLP
- DARPA’s Explainable AI (XAI) standards

## Common Patterns
1. **Hierarchical decomposition** – Breaking problems into subtasks with prioritized resolution.
2. **Premise validation loops** – Iteratively verifying assumptions against domain knowledge.
3. **Counterfactual reasoning** – Evaluating outcomes by altering variables in controlled scenarios.
4. **Multi-agent consensus** – Aggregating reasoning from specialized sub-models.
5. **Constraint propagation** – Narrowing solution spaces via interdependent rules.

## Pitfalls
- Over-reliance on heuristics without validation against ground truth.
- Ignoring edge cases in rule-based systems, leading to brittle inferences.
- Misaligning reasoning depth with task complexity (e.g., over-engineering simple queries).
- Failing to document strategy assumptions, reducing auditability.
- Neglecting computational limits, causing cascading failures in complex chains.
