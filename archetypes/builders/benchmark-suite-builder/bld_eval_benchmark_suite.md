## Quality Gate

## Definition

## Examples

## Golden Example
```markdown
---
name: "MMLU_Benchmark_Suite"
kind: benchmark_suite
description: "A comprehensive benchmark suite evaluating language models on 10+ academic disciplines"
tasks:
  - name: "Natural_Language_Reasoning"
    description: "Tests logical reasoning in natural language tasks"
    metrics: ["accuracy", "F1_score"]
    models: ["HuggingFace/T5", "Meta/Llama-2", "Anthropic/Claude-2"]
  - name: "Mathematical_Reasoning"
    description: "Evaluates mathematical problem-solving capabilities"
    metrics: ["accuracy", "perplexity"]
    models: ["Google/PaLM-2", "Anthropic/Claude-2", "HuggingFace/CodeLlama"]
  - name: "Code_Execution"
    description: "Assesses code generation and execution accuracy"
    metrics: ["execution_success", "code_quality"]
    models: ["HuggingFace/CodeLlama", "Anthropic/Claude-2", "Meta/Llama-2"]
```

## Anti-Example 1: Single Task Benchmark
```markdown
---
name: "SingleTaskBenchmark"
kind: benchmark_suite
description: "Evaluates text generation quality on a single task"
tasks:
  - name: "Text_Generation"
    description: "Tests model ability to generate coherent text"
    metrics: ["perplexity", "human_rating"]
    models: ["HuggingFace/GPT-2"]
```
## Why it fails
This is not a benchmark suite but a single benchmark. The 'benchmark_suite' kind requires multiple distinct tasks with different objectives and evaluation metrics.

## Anti-Example 2: Evaluation Framework Confusion
```markdown
---
name: "MLPerf_Evaluation"
kind: benchmark_suite
description: "MLPerf benchmarking framework for AI performance evaluation"
tasks:
  - name: "Inference_Speed"
    description: "Measures model inference throughput"
    metrics: ["queries_per_second", "latency"]
    models: ["MLPerf_Reference_Implementations"]
```

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
