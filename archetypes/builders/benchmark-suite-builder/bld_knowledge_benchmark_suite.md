## Domain Overview
Benchmark suites are collections of interdependent tasks designed to evaluate system performance across diverse workloads. In AI, they assess models on tasks like inference, training, and reasoning (e.g., MLPerf). In software engineering, they test scalability, latency, and reliability (e.g., SPEC). Suites enable holistic evaluation by combining synthetic and real-world tasks, ensuring systems are stress-tested under varied conditions. They are critical for comparing hardware, frameworks, and algorithms in competitive landscapes like cloud computing and autonomous systems.

## Key Concepts
| Concept               | Definition                                                                 | Source                              |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Task Granularity      | Level of detail in individual tasks (e.g., microbenchmarks vs. end-to-end workflows) | MLPerf 2.0                          |
| Workload Characterization | Quantification of resource demands (CPU, memory, I/O) for each task         | SPEC CPU2017                        |
| Reproducibility       | Ensuring identical results across environments using versioned inputs/parameters | Reproducibility in ML (Amershi et al., 2019) |
| Portability           | Ability to run benchmarks on heterogeneous hardware (CPU, GPU, FPGA)        | OpenBenchmarking.org                |
| Scalability Metrics   | Measures of performance as task size or concurrency increases               | ISO/IEC 25010:2011 (Software Quality) |
| Fairness Criteria     | Rules to prevent bias in task selection or scoring (e.g., avoiding skewed datasets) | FAIR Principles ( Wilkinson et al., 2016) |
| Versioning            | Tracking changes in benchmarks over time to ensure backward compatibility   | BMark Framework (GitHub)            |
| Composability         | Ability to combine tasks from different suites for custom evaluation scenarios | RFC 6713 (Benchmarking Terminology) |

## Industry Standards
- MLPerf (v2.0): AI benchmark suite for training and inference
- SPEC CPU2017: Standard for CPU performance evaluation
- ISO/IEC 25010: Software quality attributes including performance efficiency
- RFC 6713: Definitions for network protocol benchmarking
- BMark: Open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking
- FAIR Principles: Guidelines for scientific data and benchmarking

## Common Patterns
1. Modular task design: Decouple tasks for independent testing and reuse.
2. Versioned workloads: Track benchmark iterations with semantic versioning.
3. Cross-domain metrics: Use standardized KPIs (e.g., FLOPs, latency, accuracy).
4. Automated execution: Leverage CI/CD pipelines for repeatable runs.
5. Composable suites: Allow task combinations for targeted scenario testing.

## Pitfalls
- Overlooking hardware diversity: Failing to test on edge, cloud, or specialized devices.
- Single-task focus: Ignoring composite workloads that reflect real-world usage.
- Poor versioning: Inconsistent updates leading to incompatible benchmarks.
- Biased metrics: Using incomplete or skewed datasets for evaluation.
- Lack of automation: Manual execution introduces human error and inefficiency.
