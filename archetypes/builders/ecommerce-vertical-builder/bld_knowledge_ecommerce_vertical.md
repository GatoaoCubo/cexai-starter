## Domain Overview
The eCommerce industry vertical centers on digital commerce, encompassing user journeys from product discovery to purchase completion. Core components include cart/checkout systems, which must balance usability with security (e.g., PCI-DSS compliance), and recommendation engines that leverage user behavior data to drive conversions. Fraud detection is critical, with attacks like card-not-present (CNP) fraud rising 25% YoY (2023 Verizon DBIR). Use cases span personalized marketing, dynamic pricing, and inventory management, often requiring integration with third-party APIs and real-time analytics.

Key challenges involve reconciling scalability with compliance, optimizing conversion rates through A/B testing, and mitigating risks from bot traffic and account takeover. Standards like PCI-DSS and frameworks like OWASP ASVS shape technical implementations, while machine learning models (e.g., collaborative filtering) power recommendation systems.

## Key Concepts
| Concept                | Definition                                                                 | Source                              |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| PCI-DSS               | Standards for securing payment data, including encryption and access controls | PCI Security Standards Council     |
| Collaborative Filtering | Recommendation technique using user-item interaction matrices               | ACM RecSys Conference Papers       |
| Session Hijacking     | Unauthorized takeover of user sessions via token theft                      | OWASP Top 10                       |

| Tokenization          | Replacing sensitive data with tokens to reduce PCI scope                   | PCI-DSS v4.0                       |

## Industry Standards
- PCI-DSS v4.0 (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) for user data handling
- HTTP/2 (RFC 7540) for efficient checkout API communication
- OWASP ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard)
- RFC 7231 (HTTP/1.1) for request/response handling
- Netflix Recommendation System Paper (ACM 2016)
- Forrester’s Customer Journey Framework

## Common Patterns
1. **Headless commerce architecture** – Separating frontend and backend for flexibility.
2. **PCI-compliant tokenization** – Replacing payment data with tokens to reduce scope.
3. **Real-time fraud scoring** – ML models assessing risk during checkout.
4. **Personalized recommendation pipelines** – Using collaborative filtering + user behavior.
5. **Multi-channel checkout optimization** – Unified UX across web, app, and voice.

## Pitfalls
- Overlooking PCI-DSS scope reduction via tokenization.
- Overfitting recommendation models to short-term trends.
- Relying on static fraud rules instead of adaptive ML.
- Poor checkout UX leading to >70% cart abandonment.
- Ignoring bot traffic in A/B testing, skewing conversion metrics.
