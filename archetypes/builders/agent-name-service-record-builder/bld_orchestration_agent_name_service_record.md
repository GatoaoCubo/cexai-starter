# Agent Name Service Record Builder -- Collaboration

## Crew Role

This builder is the **ANS registration specialist** in the multi-agent crew.
It handles IETF ANS and CNCF AgentDNS registry-record construction for production
operators including GoDaddy and Salesforce MuleSoft Agent Fabric.
It translates agent definitions (agent_card, agent) into registry-records that
make agents discoverable across IETF ANS and CNCF AgentDNS networks.

| Role attribute | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Nucleus | N03 (Build/Create) or N05 (Operations/Deploy) |
| Phase | Late in agent lifecycle -- after agent_card is drafted |
| Blocking | Yes -- downstream discovery depends on this record |
| Parallel-safe | Yes -- one ANS record per agent, no shared state |

## Receives From

| Source kind | Pillar | Field extracted | Why needed |
|------------|--------|----------------|-----------|
| agent_card | P08 | `capabilities[]` array | Maps to `capability_advertisement.skills` |
| agent_card | P08 | `endpoint_url` | Primary endpoint for ANS record |
| agent_card | P08 | `protocol_support[]` | Seeds `protocol_adapters` entries |
| agent_card | P08 | `agent_name` or `id` | Converted to DNS-like ANS name |
| secret_config | P09 | `tls_cert_reference` or `pki_cert_id` | Becomes `pki_cert_reference` field |
| secret_config | P09 | `cert_issuer`, `cert_fingerprint` | Populates PKI-cert reference format |
| transport_config | P04 | Per-protocol endpoint URLs | Populates `protocol_adapters[].endpoint` |
| transport_config | P04 | Auth methods per protocol | Populates `protocol_adapters[].auth` |

## Produces For

| Target kind | Pillar | Field produced | How used |
|------------|--------|---------------|---------|
| search_tool | P04 | `discovery_endpoint` URL | Indexed for runtime agent lookup |
| lifecycle_rule | P12 | `lifecycle.expires` + `renewal_policy` | Triggers record renewal workflows |
| agent_card | P08 | `agent_name` (ANS name) | Back-reference in agent card for self-identification |
| workflow | P12 | `registry_id` (UUID) | References this record in multi-agent orchestration specs |
| knowledge_index | P10 | Full record content | Indexed for semantic agent discovery |

## Handoff Contract

### Incoming handoff (from N07 or N03)

When this builder receives a build task, the handoff MUST include:

```markdown
## Task
Build an ANS registry-record for agent: {agent_name_or_description}

## Required context
- agent_card path: {path_to_agent_card}
- secret_config path: {path_to_secret_config} (if PKI cert available)
- transport_config path: {path_to_transport_config} (if available)
- registry_operator: {godaddy|salesforce|cncf|self}

## Expected output
- File: P04_tools/p04_ans_{agent_slug}.md
- Kind: agent_name_service_record
- Quality target: 9.0+
```

### Outgoing signal (on completion)

```python
from _tools.signal_writer import write_signal
write_signal('n03', 'complete', 9.0)
# or n05 if deployed from operations nucleus
```

### Outgoing handoff (to lifecycle_rule)

After producing the ANS record, notify the lifecycle management system:

```markdown
## Lifecycle alert
ANS record created: {agent_name}
Expires: {lifecycle.expires}
Renewal policy: {renewal_policy}
Renewal trigger: 30 days before expiry
Action required: re-register with registry_operator={operator}
```

## Boundary Definition

| In scope | Out of scope |
|----------|-------------|
| Constructing ANS registry-records | Agent logic, behavior, or code |
| Declaring protocol-adapter entries | Implementing protocol adapters |
| Embedding PKI-cert references | Generating or renewing PKI certificates |
| Setting discovery-endpoint URLs | Building the discovery endpoint server |
| Managing lifecycle metadata | Executing renewal workflows (that is lifecycle_rule) |
| CNCF AgentDNS format compliance | Operating the AgentDNS registry infrastructure |
| Capability advertisement tables | Defining what capabilities the agent DOES (that is agent_card) |

## Concurrency Notes

| Scenario | Safe? | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Two agents registered simultaneously | YES | Different ANS names = different files |
| Same agent, two registry operators | YES | Different registry_operator values = different records |
| Updating existing ANS record | YES (solo) | Update `updated` date, bump version |
| Updating existing ANS record during grid | PROPOSAL | Write `.proposal.md` per shared-file-proposal rule |
| Batch registration (10+ agents) | YES | One file per agent, no shared state |
