## Quality Gate
# Agent Name Service Record Builder -- Quality Gate
> Governs IETF ANS / CNCF AgentDNS registry-record quality. Hard gates enforce DNS-like name format, protocol-adapter presence, discovery-endpoint validity. Soft dimensions score PKI-cert + capability richness for GoDaddy, Salesforce, CNCF operators.
## Hard Gates (H01-H08)
All 8 must pass. Any failure blocks publication.
| ID | Gate | Check | Pass | Fix |
|----|------|-------|------|-----|
| H01 | Frontmatter | YAML parses | No errors, required fields present | Fix YAML |
| H02 | ID pattern | Regex on `id` | `^p04_ans_[a-z0-9_]+$` | Rename |
| H03 | Kind | String match | `kind=="agent_name_service_record"` | Correct |
| H04 | ANS name | DNS-like | lowercase, hyphens, ends `.agents`, no underscores | Reformat |
| H05 | Endpoint | URL check | HTTPS, not localhost, not empty | Add prod URL |
| H06 | Adapters | Array size | `protocol_adapters` >=1 | Declare MCP/A2A/gRPC |
**Logic**: H01 -> H08 sequential. Any FAIL -> BLOCK (do not publish). ALL PASS -> soft scoring.
## Soft Scoring Dimensions (5D)
**Used when all hard gates pass. Weighted sum targets 9.0+**
### D1: Name Resolution Quality (weight: 0.25)
| Score | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| 1.0 | ANS name follows `{agent}.{org}.agents` 3-segment hierarchy, org matches registry_operator domain |
| 0.8 | 3-segment hierarchy correct, org does not clearly match registry_operator |
| 0.6 | 2-segment hierarchy (missing org segment) |
| 0.4 | 1 segment only, but lowercase and ends in `.agents` |
| 0.0 | Name fails DNS-like format (uppercase, underscore, wrong suffix) |
### D2: Protocol Coverage (weight: 0.25)
| Score | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| 1.0 | 3+ protocol adapters declared (e.g., MCP + A2A + gRPC) |
| 0.8 | 2 protocol adapters declared (e.g., MCP + A2A) |
| 0.6 | 1 protocol adapter, current version pinned |
| 0.4 | 1 protocol adapter, version not specified |
| 0.0 | No protocol adapters (should have failed H06) |
### D3: PKI Completeness (weight: 0.20)
| Score | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| 1.0 | PKI-cert reference present with issuer + SHA256 fingerprint, expiry in lifecycle |
| 0.8 | PKI-cert reference present, issuer only (no fingerprint) |
| 0.6 | PKI-cert field present but value is placeholder or empty string |
| 0.2 | PKI-cert field absent but record is for non-production operator (`self`) |
| 0.0 | PKI-cert field absent for GoDaddy or Salesforce registry operator |
### D4: Capability Richness (weight: 0.20)
| Score | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| 1.0 | 3+ skills, max_concurrent >= 1, supported_tasks non-empty, response_time_p95_ms present |
| 0.8 | 3+ skills, max_concurrent >= 1, supported_tasks non-empty |
| 0.6 | 1-2 skills, max_concurrent present |
| 0.4 | skills array present but empty |
| 0.0 | capability_advertisement block absent entirely |
### D5: Lifecycle Completeness (weight: 0.10)
| Score | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| 1.0 | registered + expires + renewal_policy + last_verified all present |
| 0.8 | registered + expires + renewal_policy present |
| 0.6 | registered + expires present, renewal_policy missing |
| 0.4 | registered only |
| 0.0 | lifecycle block absent (should have failed H08) |
## Scoring Formula
```
raw_score = (D1 * 0.25) + (D2 * 0.25) + (D3 * 0.20) + (D4 * 0.20) + (D5 * 0.10)
final_score = raw_score * 10
```
**Thresholds:**
| Score | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 9.0 - 10.0 | PUBLISH | Ready for registry submission |
| 8.0 - 8.9 | PUBLISH with warning | Acceptable, note soft gaps |
| 7.0 - 7.9 | REVISE | Return to Phase 2 COMPOSE, address D1+D2+D3 gaps |
| < 7.0 | REJECT | Full rebuild required -- review instruction ISO |
## Common Failure Patterns
| Failure | Root cause | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| H04 fail: ANS name has underscore | agent_slug copied from Python variable name | Replace `_` with `-` |
| H06 fail: no protocol adapters | Builder skipped Phase 1.2 | Go back to instruction ISO Phase 1.2 |
| D3 = 0.0: missing PKI-cert for GoDaddy | Forgot GoDaddy requirement | Add PKI-cert reference from secret_config |
| D4 < 0.6: empty skills | capability_advertisement block not populated | Enumerate at least 3 skills from agent spec |
| D2 = 0.6: only 1 protocol | Agent only exposes HTTP endpoint | Investigate if MCP server is available |
## Tooling
| Tool | Command | When |
|------|---------|------|
| Score artifact | `python _tools/cex_score.py --apply {path}` | After Phase 3 VALIDATE |
| Check gates only | `python _tools/cex_score.py --gates-only {path}` | Quick validation during composition |
| Doctor check | `python _tools/cex_doctor.py` | Full system health post-build |

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
