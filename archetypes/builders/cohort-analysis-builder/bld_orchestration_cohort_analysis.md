|---------------|-----------------------|-------------|  
| Data Warehouse| Raw user event data   | CSV/Parquet |  
| Product Team  | Cohort definition rules | JSON      |  
| Analyst       | Analysis parameters   | SQL         |  

## Produces For  
| Builder       | What                  | Format      |  
|---------------|-----------------------|-------------|  
| Product Team  | Cohort trend reports  | PDF/Excel   |  
| Marketing Team| Engagement metrics    | JSON        |
