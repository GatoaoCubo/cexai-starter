# Memory: workflow-builder
## Summary
Workflows orchestrate multi-step execution with sequential and parallel agents, signals, and dependency resolution. The critical production lesson is dependency explicitness — implicit dependencies between steps cause race conditions in parallel execution. Every data dependency between steps must be declared as an explicit edge in the workflow graph. The second lesson is error recovery: workflows without per-step error handling abort entirely on the first failure, wasting all completed work.
## Pattern
1. Every dependency between steps must be declared explicitly — implicit ordering causes race conditions
2. Steps that can run in parallel must be grouped into waves with clear wave boundaries
3. Each step must define its completion signal: what it emits when done, errored, or timed out
4. Error recovery must be defined per step: retry, skip, abort, or fallback to alternative step
5. Spawn configs must be referenced per agent_group step — inline spawn parameters are error-prone
6. Include a validation step after critical milestones — do not defer all validation to the final step
## Anti-Pattern
1. Implicit step ordering — parallel execution breaks when undeclared dependencies exist
2. No per-step error handling — one failed step aborts entire workflow, wasting completed work
3. Missing completion signals — orchestrator cannot detect step completion, causing infinite waits
4. Monolithic workflows with 20+ steps — decompose into sub-workflows linked by signals
5. Confusing workflow (P12, executable orchestration) with pattern (P08, documented solution) or dispatch_rule (P12, keyword routing)
6. Steps without timeout — hung steps block the entire workflow indefinitely
## Context
Workflows operate in the P12 orchestration layer as the highest-level execution construct. They coordinate multiple agents, agent_groups, and tools across sequential and parallel execution phases. Workflows consume spawn configs (how to launch agent_groups), signals (how to detect completion), and dispatch rules (how to route tasks). They are the runtime execution plan for complex multi-agent missions.
## Impact
Explicit dependency declaration eliminated 100% of race conditions in parallel workflow execution. Per-step error recovery saved 70% of completed work versus abort-on-first-failure strategies. Step timeouts prevented 100% of infinite-wait incidents.
## Reproducibility
For reliable workflow production: (1) decompose mission into discrete steps, (2) declare all inter-step dependencies explicitly, (3) group independent steps into parallel waves, (4) define completion signals per step, (5) add error recovery per step (retry/skip/abort/fallback), (6) reference spawn configs for agent_group steps, (7) set timeouts per step, (8) validate against 8 HARD + 12 SOFT gates.
