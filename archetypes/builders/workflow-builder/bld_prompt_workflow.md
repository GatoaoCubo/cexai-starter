## Context
The workflow-builder produces a `workflow` artifact -- a structured YAML that defines how agents are orchestrated at runtime. A workflow decomposes a mission into steps, assigns agents to each step, maps dependencies between steps, specifies completion signals, and defines error recovery strategy.
**Critical distinction**: a `workflow` is runtime orchestration with execution semantics (waves, signals, dependencies). It is NOT a prompt chain (`chain` -- sequential prompt calls without agent coordination), NOT a static dependency graph (`dag` -- structure only, no execution), and NOT a routing rule (`dispatch_rule` -- keyword-to-agent routing). Confusing these produces orchestration that cannot be executed.
**Input contract**:
- `mission_name`: string -- kebab-case mission identifier (e.g. `onboard-new-agent`, `research-and-publish`)
- `goal`: string -- one sentence describing the end-to-end outcome
- `steps`: list of step definition objects (see Phase 2)
- `execution_mode`: enum -- `sequential` | `parallel` | `mixed`
- `error_recovery`: enum -- `abort` | `skip_failed` | `retry`
- `max_retries`: integer -- retry attempts per step (default 2)
- `timeout_ms`: integer -- total workflow timeout (default 600000)
**Output contract**: a single `workflow` YAML with all required fields, stored at `records/workflows/{mission_name}.yaml`.
**Variables**:
- `{{mission_name}}` -- kebab-case mission identifier
- `{{goal}}` -- mission outcome sentence
- `{{step_N_id}}` -- Nth step identifier
- `{{step_N_agent}}` -- agent assigned to Nth step
- `{{step_N_signal}}` -- completion signal for Nth step
## Phases
### Phase 1: Decompose Mission into Steps
**Action**: Break the mission goal into discrete, assignable steps.
```
FOR the given mission_goal:
    1. Identify distinct deliverables (each deliverable = one step)
    2. Assign one agent per step (steps are not shared between agents)
    3. Name each step as: verb_noun (e.g. research_competitors, build_component)
Step granularity rules:
    - One step = one agent = one deliverable
    - Steps that can run independently -> parallel candidates
    - Steps that need prior output -> sequential, add depends_on
    - Max 12 steps per workflow; split into sub-workflows if larger
steps_count = len(steps)
ASSERT steps_count >= 2
```
Verifiable exit: each step has a name, an assigned agent, and one deliverable; steps_count >= 2.
### Phase 2: Define Each Step Object
**Action**: Build a complete step definition for each step.
Step object schema:
```
{
  id: string -- snake_case step identifier
  agent: string -- agent id responsible for this step
  action: string -- one-sentence description of what the agent does
  input: string or object -- what the agent receives as input
  output: string -- the deliverable produced (file path, signal, or artifact id)
  signal: string -- completion signal name emitted when step finishes
  depends_on: list of step ids or [] -- steps that must complete first
  timeout_ms: integer -- step-level timeout (overrides workflow default)
  on_failure: enum -- abort | skip | retry (overrides workflow error_recovery)
}
```
Dependency rules:
```
IF step B needs step A's output:
    step_B.depends_on = [step_A.id]
IF steps A and B are independent:
    both have depends_on = []
    both can run in parallel (if execution_mode != sequential)
IF execution_mode == "sequential":
    each step implicitly depends on the previous step (no explicit depends_on needed)
Cycle detection: depends_on must form a DAG (no circular dependencies)
```
Verifiable exit: each step has all 9 fields; depends_on forms a valid DAG (no cycles).
### Phase 3: Plan Wave Ordering
**Action**: Group steps into execution waves based on dependency resolution.
```
wave_0 = steps with depends_on == []
wave_1 = steps whose depends_on are all in wave_0
wave_N = steps whose depends_on are all in wave_0..wave_(N-1)
IF execution_mode == "sequential":
    each wave has exactly 1 step
IF execution_mode == "parallel":
    all steps with no dependencies are in wave_0
    all remaining steps form subsequent waves
IF execution_mode == "mixed":
    apply dependency resolution; group independent steps per wave
```
Wave planning rules:
- Steps in the same wave run concurrently
- A step can only start when all its depends_on steps have emitted their signals
- spawn_delay_ms=5000 is applied between wave launches (prevents terminal race conditions)
Verifiable exit: all steps are assigned to a wave; no step appears in a wave before its dependencies.
### Phase 4: Compose workflow YAML
**Action**: Assemble all resolved values into the 20-field YAML structure.
Required fields:
1. `id` -- `workflow_{{mission_name}}`
2. `kind` -- `workflow`
3. `pillar` -- `P12`
4. `version` -- `1.0.0`
5. `mission_name` -- `{{mission_name}}`
6. `goal` -- `{{goal}}`
7. `execution_mode` -- `{{execution_mode}}`
8. `steps_count` -- integer matching actual steps list length
9. `steps` -- list of step objects from Phase 2
10. `waves` -- wave groupings from Phase 3
11. `error_recovery` -- `{{error_recovery}}`
12. `max_retries` -- integer
13. `timeout_ms` -- integer
14. `spawn_delay_ms` -- `5000` (always)
