## Phase 1: RESEARCH  
1. Define segment objectives: Align with P02 goals and business constraints.  
2. Collect firmographic data: Industry, company size, revenue, geography, tech stack.  
3. Identify customer needs: Map pain points, workflows, and KPIs via interviews/surveys.  
4. Analyze constraints: Legal, technical, or operational barriers to adoption.  
5. Prioritize segments: Rank by alignment with product value proposition and scalability.  
6. Validate with stakeholders: Confirm assumptions with sales, product, and customer success.  

## Phase 2: COMPOSE  
1. Outline structure: Use bld_schema_customer_segment.md headers (e.g., Segment Name, Firmographics, Needs).
2. Populate firmographics: Include industry verticals, company size ranges, and geographic focus.
3. Detail customer needs: Specify use cases, desired outcomes, and success metrics.
4. Define constraints: List technical, financial, or regulatory limitations for the segment.
5. Align with ICP: Cross-reference with bld_output_template_customer_segment.md for consistency.
6. Add examples: Include 2-3 representative customer profiles (e.g., SaaS startup, enterprise retailer).
7. Review for clarity: Ensure language is actionable and free of jargon.
8. Finalize artifact: Format per bld_schema_customer_segment.md and bld_output_template_customer_segment.md guidelines.
9. Document sources: Cite research data, interviews, and validation steps.

## Phase 3: VALIDATE
- [ ] [OK] All data aligns with bld_schema_customer_segment.md and bld_output_template_customer_segment.md
- [ ] [OK] Firmographics and needs are specific, measurable, and actionable
- [ ] [OK] No contradictions with existing product constraints or roadmaps
- [ ] [OK] Data sources cited and stakeholder review scheduled
- [ ] [OK] Artifact is reusable for marketing, sales, and product planning
