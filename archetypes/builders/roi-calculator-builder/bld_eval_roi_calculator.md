## Examples

## Golden Example  
```yaml  
title: ROI Calculator for Cloud Migration  
author: A. Smith, Financial Analyst  
date: 2023-10-15  
inputs:  
  - Initial Investment: $5,000  
  - Monthly Cloud Cost (AWS EC2): $200  
  - Monthly Savings (vs. On-Premises): $1,000  
  - Time Horizon: 12 months  
formulas:  
  ROI: ((Monthly Savings × Time Horizon) - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment × 100  
  Payback Period: Initial Investment / Monthly Savings  
  TCO: Initial Investment + (Monthly Cloud Cost × Time Horizon)  
tco_comparison:  
  AWS: $7,400  
  Azure: $7,500  
  GCP: $7,300  
```  

## Anti-Example 1: Placeholder Names  
```yaml  
title: ROI Calculator for ProviderA  
inputs:  
  - Initial Investment: $X  
  - Monthly Cost: $Y  
formulas:  
  ROI: (Y - X) / X  
tco_comparison:  
  ProviderA: $Z  
```  
## Why it fails  
Uses generic placeholders like "ProviderA" and "$X" instead of real vendor names and concrete values, making it impossible for economic buyers to compare options or validate assumptions.  

## Anti-Example 2: Missing TCO Comparison  
```yaml  
title: ROI Calculator for AWS  
inputs:  
  - Initial Investment: $5,000  
  - Monthly Savings: $1,000  
formulas:  
  ROI: (1,000 × 12 - 5,000) / 5,000 × 100  
```  
## Why it fails  
Omits the TCO comparison section, which is critical for economic buyers to evaluate total costs across providers. Without TCO, the calculator lacks actionable insights for decision-making.

### H_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (HARD)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (min 3 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream or sibling reference
- Gate: REJECT if < 3 entries (auto-populated by cex_wikilink.py at F6.5)

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
