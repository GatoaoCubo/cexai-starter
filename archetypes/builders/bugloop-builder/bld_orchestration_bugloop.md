# Collaboration: bugloop-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "what is the automatic detect-fix-verify loop for this system?"
I do not define quality gates. I do not score rubrics.
I design automated correction cycles so systems self-heal without manual intervention.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Self-Healing System"
```
  1. benchmark-builder -> "performance thresholds for detection triggers"
  2. bugloop-builder -> "detect-fix-verify correction cycle"
  3. guardrail-builder -> "safety boundaries for auto-fix scope"
```
### Crew: "Governance Enforcement"
```
  1. axiom-builder -> "immutable rules to enforce"
  2. bugloop-builder -> "correction loop for axiom violations"
  3. e2e-eval-builder -> "end-to-end verification after fix"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: detection trigger pattern, target system/agent, fix strategy type
- optional: max_attempts, escalation target, rollback policy
### I Produce
- bugloop artifact (.md + .yaml frontmatter)
- committed to: `cex/P11/examples/p11_bugloop_{scope}.md`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons
## Builders I Depend On
- benchmark-builder: provides thresholds that trigger detection
- axiom-builder: provides invariant rules that define "correct" state
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| e2e-eval-builder | Validates that bugloop fixes pass full pipeline |
| daemon-builder | Background processes may host bugloop execution |
