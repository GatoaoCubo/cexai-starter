# Instructions: How to Produce a bugloop
## Phase 1: RESEARCH
1. Identify the target system or test suite this loop monitors
2. Catalog detection triggers: list concrete failure signatures — specific regex patterns, named test failure strings, or log scan patterns — not vague descriptions
3. Define fix strategies per failure class: assign auto_fix=true only where confidence >= 0.7, use auto_fix=false for non-deterministic or high-risk failures
4. Specify verification assertions: what must be true after a fix attempt — at minimum one named assertion with a timeout bound
5. Determine escalation thresholds: the number of failed fix attempts that triggers escalation, and the target (human role, queue name, or named system)
6. Map rollback policies: if fix strategy is rollback_first, rollback.enabled must be true — these must be consistent
## Phase 2: COMPOSE
1. Read SCHEMA.md — source of truth for all required fields
2. Read OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md — template to fill
3. Fill frontmatter: all required fields (quality: null, never self-score)
4. Write Detection section: list each trigger with its concrete pattern (regex or named signature) and the signal source (test runner output, log file, static analysis report)
5. Write Fix Strategy section: max_attempts value, auto_fix flag with rationale tied to confidence level, and the named strategy (patch_and_retry, rollback_first, or isolate_then_fix)
6. Write Verification section: test suite path or name, list of assertions that must pass, and timeout in seconds
7. Write Escalation section: threshold (must be <= cycle_count), target name, and payload content sent on escalation
8. Write Rollback section: enabled flag, strategy name (git_revert, snapshot_restore, or blue_green), and trigger condition
## Phase 3: VALIDATE
1. Check QUALITY_GATES.md manually
2. HARD gate: id matches `p11_bl_` pattern
3. HARD gate: kind == bugloop
4. HARD gate: quality == null
5. HARD gate: detection contains at least one concrete trigger with a pattern (not a description)
6. HARD gate: max_attempts is defined as an integer between 1 and 10
7. HARD gate: verification contains at least one assertion
8. HARD gate: if auto_fix == true, confidence must be >= 0.7 — reject if not
9. HARD gate: if fix strategy is rollback_first, rollback.enabled must be true — reject contradiction
10. Cross-check: is this a detect-fix-verify cycle? If it only blocks on pass/fail without attempting fixes, it is a quality_gate not a bugloop
11. Cross-check: is this driven by failure correction, not metric optimization? Metric-driven improvement is an optimizer artifact
12. If score < 8.0: revise before outputting
