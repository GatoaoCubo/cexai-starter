## Observation
Common issues include ambiguous region boundaries, conflicting residency rules across systems, and incomplete mapping of data flows to regulatory zones. Overlooking hybrid cloud environments often leads to non-compliance gaps.

## Pattern
Successful configurations use standardized region codes (e.g., ISO 3166-1), enforce strict separation of residency rules from access policies, and validate data flow paths against compliance frameworks.

## Evidence
Reviewed artifacts showed EU regions using ISO codes with explicit data transfer clauses, while Asia-Pacific configurations included localized storage mandates.

## Recommendations
- Adopt ISO-standard region codes to avoid ambiguity.
- Modularize residency rules to isolate compliance logic from infrastructure configs.
- Automate validation of data flow paths against residency specs.
- Document exceptions for cross-border transfers with legal review markers.
- Periodically audit residency mappings against evolving regulatory updates.
