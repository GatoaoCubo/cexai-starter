## ID Pattern
^p09_dr_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+.md$

## Body Structure
1. **Data Residency Policy**
   Define legal and operational rules for data storage locations.

2. **Compliance Frameworks**
   List regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) governing data residency.

3. **Data Encryption Standards**
   Specify encryption algorithms and key management practices.

4. **Data Location Mapping**
   Map data categories to physical/jurisdictional storage locations.

5. **Audit Requirements**
