Defines data residency rules and maps data assets to geographic regions based on regulatory requirements.

| Builder         | What                  | Format  |  
|-----------------|-----------------------|---------|

| compliance_officer | Regulatory requirements | JSON  |  
| geography_mapper | Region mappings       | YAML    |  

## Produces For  
| Builder         | What                  | Format  |

| data_governance | Residency policies    | JSON    |  
| infrastructure  | Region-specific configs | YAML  |  
| compliance_team | Validation reports    | PDF     |
