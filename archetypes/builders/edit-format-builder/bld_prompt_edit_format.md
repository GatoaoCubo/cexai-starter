## Phase 1: RESEARCH  

This ISO specifies an edit format: how diffs or patches are expressed and applied.
1. Analyze existing LLM-to-host communication protocols for file change syntax.  
2. Identify constraints from P06 (e.g., security, versioning, error handling).  
3. Survey use cases for edit_format (e.g., code patches, config updates).  
4. Determine required syntax elements (e.g., diff format, metadata fields).  
5. Evaluate tooling compatibility (e.g., Git, JSON, YAML parsers).  
6. Document research findings into a preliminary specification draft.  

## Phase 2: COMPOSE  
1. Define schema structure in SCHEMA.md (e.g., `operation`, `file_path`, `content`).  
2. Map each schema field to corresponding OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md placeholders.  
3. Specify syntax rules (e.g., line endings, escaping characters).  
4. Add constraints (e.g., max file size, allowed operations).  
5. Write template examples for common operations (e.g., `replace`, `append`).  
6. Align template with SCHEMA.md using cross-references.  
7. Include error codes and handling procedures per P06.  
8. Add versioning metadata to both schema and template.  
9. Finalize artifact with review checklists from Phase 3.  

## Phase 3: VALIDATE  
- [ ] Validate schema against 10+ example edits using SCHEMA.md.  
- [ ] Test OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md with edge cases (e.g., binary files).  
- [ ] Confirm tooling compatibility (e.g., parsers, validators).  
- [ ] Ensure all P06 constraints are explicitly addressed.  
- [ ] Perform peer review for clarity and completeness.
