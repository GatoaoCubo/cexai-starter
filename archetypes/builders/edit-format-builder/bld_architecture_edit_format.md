## Component Inventory

This ISO specifies an edit format: how diffs or patches are expressed and applied.

| Name | Role | Owner | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| Format Spec Registry | Catalog of valid format_type/edit_scope combinations | edit_format-builder | Active |
| Syntax Validator | Checks LLM output conforms to declared format_type (markers, structure) | host tooling | Active |
| SEARCH Matcher | Locates SEARCH block content in target file (exact or fuzzy) | diff_strategy-builder | Active |
| Whole-File Applier | Replaces file content verbatim from LLM output | host tooling | Active |
| Unified Diff Applier | Applies `--- a/` / `+++ b/` / `@@` patch via git-apply or patch(1) | host tooling | Active |
| JSON Patch Engine | Executes RFC 6902 operations on JSON/YAML config files | host tooling | Active |
| LSP TextEdit Engine | Applies range-based edits via Language Server Protocol | IDE / LSP client | Active |
| Format Router | Selects format_type based on file size, change scope, tool capability | code_executor | Active |

## Dependencies

| From | To | Type | Notes |
|------|----|------|-------|
| SEARCH Matcher | diff_strategy | required | Matching algorithm is diff_strategy's concern, not edit_format |
| Syntax Validator | Format Spec Registry | required | Validates against declared format_type rules |
| Format Router | Format Spec Registry | required | Reads compatible_tools to select format |
| Whole-File Applier | Format Spec Registry | data | Validates path + content structure |
| Unified Diff Applier | git / patch(1) | required | External tooling handles actual application |

## Architectural Position

`edit_format` is the wire format layer in the LLM code-agent edit pipeline:

```
[LLM reasoning / code generation]
      |
      | emits edit in declared format_type
      v
[edit_format spec]    <-- THIS BUILDER: defines valid syntax the LLM must use
      |
      | validated by Syntax Validator
      v
[diff_strategy]       <-- locates WHERE in the file to apply (SEARCH match, line anchoring)
      |
      v
[host applier]        <-- Whole-File Applier / Unified Diff Applier / JSON Patch Engine
      |
      v
[file system]
```

Adjacent builders:
- `diff_strategy_builder`: matching algorithms (exact, fuzzy, semantic) for locating SEARCH
- `formatter_builder`: output formatting, code style, indentation (separate from edit format)
- `code_executor_builder`: runs the edited code, validates correctness after application
- `parser_builder`: parses LLM response to extract edit blocks from prose context
