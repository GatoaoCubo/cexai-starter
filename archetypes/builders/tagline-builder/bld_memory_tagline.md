# Memory: Tagline Builder

## What to Remember
1. User's preferred tone/style from previous tagline requests
2. Rejected taglines and WHY (never suggest again)
3. Approved taglines (maintain consistency in future requests)
4. Brand voice evolution over time
5. Competitor taglines encountered (avoid similarity)

## Memory Types
1. PREFERENCE: user's tone choice (formal vs casual, emotional vs functional)
2. CORRECTION: "don't use puns", "shorter is better", specific word avoidance
3. CONVENTION: brand language rules (always use X word, never use Y)
4. CONTEXT: industry norms, competitor landscape, cultural considerations
