## Component Inventory
| Name | Role | Owner | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| trigger | Temporal firing mechanism — cron, interval, event, manual, one_shot | schedule | required |
| cron_expression | POSIX 5- or 6-field time pattern defining recurrence | schedule | required |
| timezone | IANA timezone resolving clock-relative trigger times | schedule | required |
| workflow_ref | Reference to the workflow artifact this schedule starts | schedule | required |
| enabled | Active/paused flag controlling whether trigger fires | schedule | required |
| catch_up | Backfill policy for missed intervals on restart | schedule | required |
| max_concurrent | Cap on parallel in-flight runs of the triggered workflow | schedule | required |
| jitter | Random delay window to stagger simultaneous trigger fires | schedule | optional |
| start_date | Earliest date the schedule is allowed to fire | schedule | optional |
| end_date | Latest date the schedule is allowed to fire | schedule | optional |
| workflow | Execution logic started by this schedule | P13 | consumer |
| guardrail | Execution constraints applied to triggered workflow runs | P11 | external |
| monitor | Observability layer tracking schedule fires and outcomes | P12 | external |

| From | To | Type | Data |
|------|----|------|------|
| timezone | trigger | produces | resolved wall-clock fire time |
| cron_expression | trigger | produces | recurrence pattern |
| enabled | trigger | produces | whether to fire or skip |
| trigger | workflow_ref | produces | workflow start event |
| catch_up | trigger | depends | backfill policy on restart |
| max_concurrent | workflow_ref | depends | concurrency cap on workflow execution |
| jitter | trigger | depends | randomized start delay |
| guardrail | workflow_ref | depends | timeout and resource constraints |
| monitor | trigger | depends | fire/skip/fail event stream |
## Boundary Table
| schedule IS | schedule IS NOT |
|-------------|----------------|
| Temporal trigger — answers WHEN | Workflow — answers WHAT (steps, logic) |
| Declares cron/interval/event firing rule | Dispatch rule — routes keywords to workflows |
| Fires workflow_ref and exits | Hook — reacts to events as side effects |
| Stateless trigger definition | Daemon — persistent background process |
| One schedule per workflow cadence | Skill — reusable multi-phase capability |
## Layer Map
| Layer | Components | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| time-resolution | cron_expression, timezone | Compute exact UTC fire instants |
| gate | enabled, start_date, end_date | Control whether trigger fires in window |
| dispatch | trigger, workflow_ref | Start target workflow execution |
| policy | catch_up, max_concurrent, jitter | Govern concurrency, backfill, and load |
| governance | guardrail, monitor | Constrain and observe triggered runs |
