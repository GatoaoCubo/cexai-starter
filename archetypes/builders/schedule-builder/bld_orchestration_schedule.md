# Collaboration: schedule-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "when does this workflow run, at what cadence, in what timezone, with what overlap and catch-up policy?"
I do not define what the workflow does. I do not route keywords to workflows. I do not react to events as side effects.
I specify temporal triggers so orchestrators, agents, and runtime schedulers know exactly when to start a workflow.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Scheduled Workflow System"
```
  1. workflow-builder    -> "workflow definition (steps, logic, outputs)"
  2. schedule-builder    -> "temporal trigger (when, timezone, policy)"
  3. guardrail-builder   -> "execution constraints (timeout, retry, resource caps)"
```
### Crew: "Orchestration Layer"
```
  1. schedule-builder    -> "when to start (cron, interval, event)"
  2. dispatch_rule-builder -> "which workflow handles a message (keyword routing)"
  3. monitor-builder     -> "observe fires, skips, failures, durations"
```
### Crew: "Data Pipeline"
```
  1. schedule-builder    -> "daily/hourly trigger for ETL workflow"
  2. workflow-builder    -> "ETL steps (extract, transform, load)"
  3. hook-builder        -> "post-load side effects (notify, invalidate cache)"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: workflow_ref id, desired cadence, business timezone, domain context
- optional: catch_up requirement, concurrency constraints, infrastructure sharing context
### I Produce
- schedule artifact (.md with YAML frontmatter)
- committed to: `cex/P12_orchestration/examples/p12_sched_{name}.md`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with specific gate failures listed
## Builders I Depend On
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| workflow-builder | workflow_ref must resolve to an existing workflow artifact |
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| guardrail-builder | Guardrails apply timeout and resource caps to schedule-triggered runs |
| monitor-builder | Monitors subscribe to schedule fire events to track execution history |
| hook-builder | Hooks may fire on schedule completion events as post-run side effects |
| instruction-builder | Recipes reference schedules as the activation mechanism for workflows |
## Boundary Enforcement
When a request arrives that is NOT a schedule, redirect explicitly:
| Request | Correct builder | Reason |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| "route keyword X to workflow Y" | dispatch_rule-builder | That is routing, not timing |
| "define steps for the report" | workflow-builder | That is execution logic, not trigger |
| "fire when file arrives in S3" | hook-builder | That is event reaction, not cron schedule |
| "run this once on deploy" | hook-builder | One-time deploy event, not a schedule |
| "keep polling every 5s forever" | daemon-builder | Persistent loop, not a schedule artifact |
