# Architecture: deployment_manifest

## Relationship Graph
```
[workflow] --> [deployment_manifest] --> [env_config]
                     |                        |
                     +--> [canary_config]      +--> [secret_config]
                     |
                     +--> [sandbox_spec] (test only, not production)
                     |
                     +--> [slo_definition] (success criteria post-deploy)
```

## Kind Boundaries
| Kind | Relationship | Boundary |
|------|-------------|---------|
| env_config | USES | deployment_manifest references env_config; does not define runtime vars inline |
| canary_config | SIBLING | canary_config handles traffic split; deployment_manifest handles artifact list + target |
| sandbox_spec | EXCLUDES | sandbox_spec is ephemeral test env; deployment_manifest targets stable envs |
| workflow | PARENT | workflow steps may include deployment_manifest as a COLLABORATE step |
| slo_definition | POST-DEPLOY | slo_definition defines success metrics measured after deployment completes |
| secret_config | REFERENCES | secrets are referenced by path only, never inlined |

## Integration Points
- **Upstream**: workflow (F8 COLLABORATE step), handoff (triggering context)
- **Downstream**: env_config (variable injection), slo_definition (success gate), signal (deploy complete)
- **Sibling**: canary_config (traffic split), sandbox_spec (test env)

## Pillar Placement
Pillar P09 (Config) -- deployment_manifest is a configuration artifact, not a runtime executable. It specifies parameters for a deployment tool (Kubernetes, Helm, custom runner) to execute.
