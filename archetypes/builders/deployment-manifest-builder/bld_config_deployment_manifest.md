# Context Sources: deployment_manifest Builder

## Injection Order (F3 INJECT)

| Priority | Source | Path | Why |
|----------|--------|------|-----|
| 1 | Schema | archetypes/builders/deployment-manifest-builder/bld_schema_deployment_manifest.md | Field names + constraints |
| 2 | Knowledge Card | N00_genesis/P01_knowledge/library/kind/kc_deployment_manifest.md | Domain definition |
| 3 | Examples | archetypes/builders/deployment-manifest-builder/bld_examples_deployment_manifest.md | Golden reference |
| 4 | Quality Gate | archetypes/builders/deployment-manifest-builder/bld_quality_gate_deployment_manifest.md | Validation rules |
| 5 | env_config KC | N00_genesis/P01_knowledge/library/kind/kc_env_config.md | Config override context |
| 6 | canary_config KC | N00_genesis/P01_knowledge/library/kind/kc_canary_config.md | Boundary clarification |
| 7 | Memory | archetypes/builders/deployment-manifest-builder/bld_memory_deployment_manifest.md | Recalled corrections |

## Similarity Scan (F5 CALL)
Run retriever against: `N0X_*/P09_config/p09_dm_*.md` to find existing manifests for the same domain.

## Configuration Checklist

- Verify all required fields are present in frontmatter before saving
- Validate config values against schema constraints (type, range, enum)
- Cross-reference with related configs to avoid contradictions
- Test config loading in target runtime before committing

## Validation

```yaml
# Required config validation
fields_present: true
types_valid: true
ranges_checked: true
cross_refs_verified: true
```

```bash
python _tools/cex_compile.py {FILE}
python _tools/cex_doctor.py --scope {BUILDER}
```
