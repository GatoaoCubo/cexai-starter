# Collaboration: pattern-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "what is the named, reusable solution for this recurring problem?"
I formalize architecture patterns with problem, solution, forces, consequences, and applicability. I do NOT write inviolable rules (invariant-builder), draw visual diagrams (diagram-builder), or define executable workflows (workflow-builder).
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Architecture Documentation Suite"
```
  1. pattern-builder       -> "formalizes the reusable solution with forces and consequences"
  2. diagram-builder       -> "produces visual representation of the pattern structure"
  3. invariant-builder           -> "encodes non-negotiable constraints the pattern must respect"
```
### Crew: "Knowledge Base Construction"
```
  1. learning-record-builder  -> "captures what worked in forctice"
  2. pattern-builder          -> "formalizes recurring solution from learning records"
  3. knowledge-card-builder   -> "assembles pattern into searchable brain card"
```
### Crew: "Agent Design Documentation"
```
  1. pattern-builder          -> "captures recurring agent interaction pattern"
  2. agent-card-builder   -> "references applicable patterns in agent_group spec"
  3. instruction-builder      -> "turns the pattern into step-by-step agent instructions"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: pattern name, recurring problem description, known solution examples
- optional: related patterns, known anti-patterns, applicability constraints
### I Produce
- pattern artifact (Markdown, max 4KB, density >= 0.80)
- committed to: `cex/P08/examples/p08_pat_{name}.md`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons
## Builders I Depend On
- learning-record-builder: repeated learning records reveal recurring patterns worth formalizing
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| invariant-builder | proven patterns may become mandatory inviolable laws |
| agent-card-builder | agent_group specs reference applicable patterns |
| instruction-builder | translates pattern solution into executable agent steps |
| knowledge-card-builder | ingests patterns as core knowledge artifacts |
| axiom-builder | universal patterns may crystallize into system axioms |
