# Config: pattern Production Rules
## Naming Convention
| Scope | Convention | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Artifact files | `p08_pat_{slug}.md` | `p08_pat_continuous_batching.md` |
| Builder directory | kebab-case | `pattern-builder/` |
| Frontmatter fields | snake_case | `related_patterns`, `anti_patterns` |
| Slug | lowercase + underscores | `continuous_batching` |
Rule: id MUST equal filename stem.
## File Paths
1. Output: `cex/P08_architecture/examples/p08_pat_{slug}.md`
2. Compiled: `cex/P08_architecture/compiled/p08_pat_{slug}.yaml`
## Size Limits (aligned with SCHEMA)
1. Body: max 4096 bytes
2. Total: ~5300 bytes (frontmatter + body)
3. Density: >= 0.80
## Pattern-Specific Constraints
1. Name: 2-5 words, Title Case (e.g., "Continuous Batching", "Signal Monitor")
2. Problem recurrence: must describe a situation that happens repeatedly
3. Forces minimum: at least 2 competing tensions
4. Consequences balance: MUST include at least 1 cost/drawback alongside benefits
5. Examples minimum: at least 2 concrete, named applications
6. Solution concreteness: must describe HOW (steps or diagram), not just WHAT
7. Anti-patterns: specific wrong approaches, not generic warnings
8. No prescriptive language: "consider" not "you must" (patterns recommend, laws mandate)
