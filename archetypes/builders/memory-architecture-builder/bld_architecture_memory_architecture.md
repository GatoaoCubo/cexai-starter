## Architectural Position

memory_architecture is a P10 (Memory) kind. It defines the structural blueprint for
how an LLM agent manages context across sessions. It is the parent artifact that
consolidation_policy (eviction rules) and procedural_memory (skill storage schema)
operate within. An agent system typically has one memory_architecture artifact per
agent type, with consolidation_policy and procedural_memory artifacts as children.
