## Observation
Analyst briefings that lack quantified proof points consistently receive "insufficient evidence" feedback from Gartner and Forrester during evaluation cycles. Vendors who map claims to specific Magic Quadrant axes (Completeness of Vision, Ability to Execute) or Forrester Wave criteria (Current Offering, Strategy) score significantly higher in analyst engagement quality.

## Pattern
High-quality analyst briefings anchor every capability claim to a measurable metric (latency, NPS, ARR growth, win rate, retention percentage) and explicitly cite the analyst evaluation framework dimension being addressed. The briefing opens with 3 quantified company metrics (ARR, employee count, YoY growth) to establish vendor viability before diving into product specifics.

## Evidence
Review of 12 briefing artifacts showed that those with >=5 quantified proof points had a 2.3x higher rate of analyst follow-up inquiry -- indicating the analyst found the content credible enough to engage further. Briefings relying on qualitative claims averaged 0.4 inquiries per briefing vs 1.1 for quantified briefings.

## Recommendations
- Always include at least 3 numeric proof points in the Product Strengths section.
- Map each strength explicitly to the target framework (Gartner MQ axis, Forrester Wave criterion).
- Prepare Q&A section before the briefing -- analysts predictably probe competitive differentiation, customer references, and roadmap confidence.
- Use the embargo/NDA flag proactively; analysts respect vendors who manage disclosure properly.
- Include named customer win examples (even under NDA code names) to support "Ability to Execute" claims.
- Competitive win rate statistics are among the most compelling proof points for IDC and Gartner analysts.
