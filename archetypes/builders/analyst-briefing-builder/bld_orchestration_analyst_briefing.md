## Crew Role
Synthesizes product and market intelligence into structured analyst briefing narratives aligned with Gartner, Forrester, and IDC evaluation frameworks. Serves as the primary AR content production component in analyst-facing workflows.

## Receives From
| Builder / Source       | What                                  | Format   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------|
| knowledge_card-builder | Market and competitive intelligence   | Markdown |
| case_study-builder     | Customer reference proof points       | Markdown |
| benchmark-builder      | Performance and TCO proof points      | Markdown |
| Internal CRM           | ARR, win rate, customer count         | JSON     |
| Product marketing      | Positioning statements, roadmap       | Markdown |

## Produces For
| Builder / Consumer      | What                                   | Format   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------|
| AR team                 | Final briefing document for analysts   | Markdown |
| RFI response workflow   | Vendor response to analyst RFI         | Markdown |
| knowledge_card-builder  | Analyst feedback and positioning notes | Markdown |

## Boundary
Does NOT produce sales pitch decks (handled by `landing_page-builder`), press releases (handled by marketing), or customer case studies (handled by `case_study-builder`). Legal review of embargo content is managed by the Legal Team, not this builder. Does NOT claim specific Magic Quadrant positions -- positions are analyst-determined; builder can only claim "target" or "submitted" positions.
