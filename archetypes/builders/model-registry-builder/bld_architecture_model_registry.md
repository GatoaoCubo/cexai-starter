## Architectural Position
The model_registry-builder serves as the central source of truth within the CEX ecosystem, acting as the bridge between experimental ML training pipelines and production inference services. Positioned within the P10 pillar, it provides standardized model versioning, lineage tracking, and lifecycle management, ensuring all downstream deployment components consume validated and audited model artifacts.
