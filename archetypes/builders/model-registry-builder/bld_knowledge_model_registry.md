## Domain Overview
The Model Registry serves as the central nervous system for MLOps, acting as a centralized repository for managing the lifecycle of machine learning models. Unlike simple storage, a registry provides the governance, versioning, and metadata management necessary to transition models from experimental training phases to production-ready assets.

In enterprise environments, the registry enables organizational scalability by providing a single source of truth for model discovery and deployment. It facilitates rigorous auditing and compliance by maintaining a clear link between a registered model, its training lineage, and its operational status within the deployment pipeline.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Definition | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Model Versioning | Unique identification of model iterations | MLOps Standards |
| Model Lineage | Traceability to training data and code | Data Governance |
| Model Stage | Lifecycle state (e.g., Staging, Production) | CI/CD Pipelines |
| Model Metadata | Contextual info (metrics, params, env) | Model Management |
| Model Signature | Input/output schema definition | Model Serving |
| Model Promotion | Transitioning models through lifecycle stages | DevOps/MLOps |
| Model Artifact | The serialized model file (e.g., .onnx, .pkl) | Model Storage |
| Model Registry API | Programmatic interface for model management | Software Engineering |
| Model Audit Trail | Log of all changes and access to models | Compliance/Security |
| Model Dependency | Required runtime libraries and versions | Containerization |

## Industry Standards
* MLflow Model Registry
* Kubeflow Models
* DVC (Data Version Control)
* AWS SageMaker Model Registry
* Google Vertex AI Model Registry
* ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) for interoperability

## Common Patterns
1. Immutable Versioning: Ensuring once a version is registered, its artifacts and metadata cannot be altered.
2. Stage-Gate Promotion: Requiring automated validation tests to pass before a model moves to 'Production'.
3. Metadata-Driven Deployment: Triggering CD pipelines based on specific tags or stage changes in the registry
