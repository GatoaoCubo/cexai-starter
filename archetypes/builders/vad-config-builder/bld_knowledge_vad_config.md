## Domain Overview  
Voice Activity Detection (VAD) is a critical preprocessing step in speech processing systems, enabling the separation of speech from non-speech segments (e.g., silence, noise). It underpins applications like conferencing, voice assistants, and transcription by improving signal quality and reducing computational load. VAD configurations balance sensitivity (detecting speech) and specificity (avoiding false positives), often tailored to environments with varying noise levels, speaker characteristics, and language nuances.  

Modern VAD systems leverage machine learning models (e.g., neural networks) or rule-based thresholds (energy, zero-crossing rates) to detect speech activity. Key parameters include silence/speech timeouts, noise suppression levels, and adaptive algorithms for dynamic environments. VAD is distinct from speech recognition (STT) but interacts closely with it, ensuring only relevant audio is processed downstream.

**Silero VAD v4** (recommended default): 1MB ONNX model, 8kHz/16kHz, threshold 0.0-1.0 (recommended 0.5), false positive rate <5% on NOIZEUS. Used in production by LiveKit, daily.co, Whisper-streaming.

**WebRTC VAD** (recommended for low-latency edge): Google-authored, aggressiveness 0-3, frame sizes 10/20/30ms at 8/16/32/48kHz, <5ms latency, well-understood tradeoffs.

**Picovoice Cobra** (recommended for on-device/IoT): Neural VAD, <2ms latency on ARM Cortex-M, threshold 0.0-1.0, runs on Raspberry Pi, iOS, Android. Commercial license required.

**ten-vad** (recommended for streaming pipelines): Apache 2.0 neural VAD designed for real-time streaming, integrates with LiveKit and Daily.co WebRTC stacks, threshold 0.0-1.0.

## Industry Standards  
- ITU-T P.501: Voice activity detection for telephony  
- WebRTC VAD: Open-source implementation for real-time communication  
- Kaldi VAD: Speech recognition toolkit with configurable VAD modules  
- ISO/IEC 23608: Speech processing standards for noise reduction  

## Common Patterns  
1. Use dual-threshold detection for robust onset/offset identification.  
2. Apply adaptive algorithms to handle dynamic noise environments.  
3. Optimize frame size for trade-offs between latency and accuracy.  
4. Combine energy and spectral features for improved confidence scoring.  
5. Integrate endpoint detection to minimize non-speech segments.  
6. Tune thresholds per language to account for phonetic differences.  

## Pitfalls  
- Ignoring noise suppression leads to false positives in noisy environments.  
- Static thresholds fail in varying acoustic conditions (e.g., meetings vs. outdoors).  
- Over-reliance on energy alone misses non-energy-based speech (e.g., whispers).  
- Neglecting endpoint detection causes incomplete speech segments.
