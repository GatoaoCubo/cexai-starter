## Crew Role  
Specializes in crafting and validating Voice Activity Detection (VAD) configurations, ensuring optimal silence/voice thresholds, sensitivity, and language-specific tuning for downstream processing.  

## Receives From  
| Builder         | What                          | Format      |  
|-----------------|-------------------------------|-------------|  
| voice_pipeline_builder | Audio sample rate, language | JSON        |  
| stt_provider_builder   | Sensitivity thresholds      | YAML        |  
| user_input      | Use case (e.g., noisy env)    | Structured  |  

## Produces For  
| Builder         | What                          | Format      |  
|-----------------|-------------------------------|-------------|  
| voice_pipeline_builder | VAD config file             | JSON        |  
| validation_team | Configuration validation report | CSV         |  
| deployment_team | Summary of applied settings   | Markdown    |  

## Boundary  
Does NOT handle full voice pipeline architecture (voice_pipeline_builder) or transcription provider integration (stt_provider_builder). Those are managed by dedicated builders.
