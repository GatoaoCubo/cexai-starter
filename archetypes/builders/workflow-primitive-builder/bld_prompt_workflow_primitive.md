## Context
The workflow-primitive-builder produces `workflow_primitive` artifacts — YAML definitions of
atomic orchestration building blocks. A workflow primitive is the smallest reusable unit of
a workflow: it takes typed inputs, performs one operation, and produces typed outputs. Seven
types exist: step (single action), condition (branch), loop (repeat), parallel (fan-out),
router (dynamic dispatch), gate (sync barrier), and merge (fan-in). Primitives compose
left-to-right into full workflows.
**Input contract**:
- `{{type}}`: one of step, condition, loop, parallel, router, gate, merge
- `{{name}}`: descriptive name for this primitive instance (e.g. `research_step`, `quality_gate`)
- `{{inputs}}`: list of typed input fields the primitive consumes
- `{{outputs}}`: list of typed output fields the primitive produces
**Output contract**: A single `workflow_primitive` YAML file named `p12_wp_`{{type}}`.yaml`,
under 4096 bytes, with type, inputs, outputs, and guard clauses. No full workflow graphs,
no DAG edges, no signal payloads.
**Boundaries**:
- A workflow primitive is atomic — one type, one operation, one file.
- Full multi-step workflows belong in a workflow artifact.
- DAG edge definitions belong in a DAG artifact.
- Inter-agent signals belong in a signal artifact.
## Phases
### Phase 1: Classify
**Primary action**: Confirm this is an atomic workflow block and determine the required
structure based on primitive type.
```
INPUT: type, name, inputs, outputs, guards
1. Confirm this is an atomic building block, not a full workflow or DAG:
   Is it a single operation with typed I/O?               -> workflow_primitive
   Is it multiple operations connected by edges?          -> NOT a workflow_primitive
   Is it an inter-agent status notification?              -> NOT a workflow_primitive
2. Validate type:
   Must be one of: step, condition, loop, parallel, router, gate, merge
   Each type has specific required guards:
     step:      none (simplest primitive)
     condition: requires condition_expr (boolean expression)
     loop:      requires max_iter (integer > 0)
     parallel:  requires merge_ref (reference to corresponding merge primitive)
     router:    requires routes (list of {match, target} pairs)
     gate:      requires threshold (float 0.0-1.0 or integer count)
     merge:     requires strategy (all, any, first, majority)
3. Validate inputs:
   Each input must have: name (string), type (string), required (boolean)
   At least 1 input required (primitives do not create data from nothing)
4. Validate outputs:
   Each output must have: name (string), type (string)
   At least 1 output required (primitives do not consume data without producing)
5. Validate guards (type-specific):
   loop: max_iter must be integer > 0 and <= 100
   gate: threshold must be numeric (0.0-1.0 for ratio, integer for count)
   parallel: timeout_s must be integer > 0
OUTPUT: validated_type, validated_inputs, validated_outputs, validated_guards
```
Verification: `validated_type` is in the 7-value enum. Inputs and outputs are typed.
Type-specific guards are present and valid.
### Phase 2: Compose
**Primary action**: Assemble the YAML primitive with typed I/O, guards, and
composition metadata.
```
INPUT: validated_type, name, validated_inputs, validated_outputs, validated_guards
1. Set filename: p12_wp_{{type}}.yaml (or p12_wp_{{type}}_{{name}}.yaml if named)
2. Assemble frontmatter:
   id: p12_wp_{{type}}
   kind: workflow_primitive
   pillar: P12
   type: {{type}}
   quality: null
3. Compose inputs list:
   For each input:
     name: field name (snake_case)
     type: data type (string, integer, float, boolean, list, object, artifact_ref)
     required: true | false
     description: one-line purpose
4. Compose outputs list:
   For each output:
     name: field name (snake_case)
     type: data type
     description: one-line purpose
5. Add type-specific guards per type:
   step: none | condition: condition_expr, true/false_branch
   loop: max_iter(1-100), break_condition, feedback_input
   parallel: branches, timeout_s, merge_ref
   router: routes [{match,target}], default_route
   gate: threshold(0-1 or count), wait_for, timeout_s
   merge: strategy(all|any|first|majority), source_refs
6. Add composition metadata:
   composable_after: list of primitive types that can precede this
   composable_before: list of primitive types that can follow this
7. Size check:
   Estimate YAML byte count
   If > 4096 bytes: compress descriptions
   until size <= 4096 bytes
OUTPUT: workflow_primitive YAML content (assembled, not yet validated)
```
Verification: all required fields present. Type-specific guards present. Inputs
and outputs are typed. Size <= 4096 bytes.
### Phase 3: Validate
**Primary action**: Run all quality gates against the assembled YAML and output the
final file only if all HARD gates pass.
```
INPUT: workflow_primitive YAML content
1. HARD quality gates (all must pass):
   HARD_1: id matches pattern ^p12_wp_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$
   HARD_2: kind == "workflow_primitive"
   HARD_3: type is one of: step, condition, loop, parallel, router, gate, merge
   HARD_4: inputs is non-empty list with typed entries
   HARD_5: outputs is non-empty list with typed entries
   HARD_6: loop type has max_iter > 0 and <= 100
   HARD_7: parallel type has merge_ref pointing to a merge primitive
   HARD_8: gate type has numeric threshold
   HARD_9: quality == null
   HARD_10: YAML parses without syntax errors
   HARD_11: total YAML size <= 4096 bytes
   HARD_12: no full workflow graph or DAG in the primitive
2. Scope check:
   Verify primitive is atomic: one type, one operation
   Verify primitive contains no signal payloads or handoff instructions
   Verify composition metadata is consistent with type
3. If all HARD gates pass: emit file
   If any HARD gate fails: return to Phase 2 with failure reasons
OUTPUT: validated workflow_primitive YAML file
```
