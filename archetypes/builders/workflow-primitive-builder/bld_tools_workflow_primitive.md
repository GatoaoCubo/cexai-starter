# Tools: workflow-primitive-builder
## Production Tools
| Tool | Purpose | When | Status |
|------|---------|------|--------|
| `cex_mission_runner.py` | Executes primitives in wave order during missions | Runtime execution | ACTIVE |
| `cex_coordinator.py` | Manages synthesis gates between workflow waves | Wave orchestration | ACTIVE |
| `cex_compile.py` | Compiles .md/.yaml to indexed artifacts | Post-save compilation | ACTIVE |
| `cex_doctor.py` | Builder health check — validates primitive structure | Validation phase | ACTIVE |
| `cex_signal_watch.py` | Monitors signals that feed into gate primitives | Gate threshold input | CONDITIONAL |
| `cex_score.py` | Peer review scoring (--apply) | Quality assessment | CONDITIONAL |
## Runtime Interfaces
| Interface | Path | Use |
|-----------|------|-----|
| Primitive output directory | `P12_orchestration/compiled/` | write compiled YAML primitive files |
| P12 schema | `P12_orchestration/_schema.yaml` | naming, format, limits |
| Primitive template | `P12_orchestration/templates/tpl_workflow_primitive.md` | human reference for primitive structure |
| SDK workflow module | `cex_sdk/workflow/` | runtime primitive instantiation |
| Mission runner | `_tools/cex_mission_runner.py` | wave execution engine |
| Coordinator | `_tools/cex_coordinator.py` | synthesis gate management |
| Signal directory | `.cex/runtime/signals/` | signals that feed gate thresholds |
## Tool Permissions

| Category | Tools | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| ALLOWED | Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep | Explicitly permitted |
| DENIED | (none) | Explicitly blocked |
| EFFECTIVE | Bash, Edit, Glob, Grep, Read, Write | ALLOWED minus DENIED |

## Interim Validation
Until a dedicated workflow_primitive validator exists, validate manually:
- filename matches `p12_wp_{type}.yaml` or `p12_wp_{type}_{name}.yaml`
- YAML parses without errors
- required fields present: type, description, inputs, outputs
- type is one of the 7-value enum
- each input has name, type, required
- each output has name, type
- loop has max_iter (1-100)
- parallel has merge_ref
- gate has numeric threshold
- router has default_route
- no full workflow graph in the primitive
- total size <= 4096 bytes
