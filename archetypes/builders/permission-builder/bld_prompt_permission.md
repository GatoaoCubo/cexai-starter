## Context
The permission-builder receives a **resource or artifact description** and produces a `permission` artifact encoding thand access control rules for that scope — who can read, write, and execute it, under what conditions, and how access is inherited.
**Input variables**:
- `{{scope}}` — the resource, artifact, or agent being protected (e.g., `artifact_store`, `signal_writer`, `admin_dashboard`)
- `{{roles}}` — list of roles that interact with the scope (e.g., `[admin, editor, viewer, service_account]`)
- `{{operations}}` — the operations requiring control: any combination of `read`, `write`, `execute`
- `{{access_model}}` — optional: `RBAC` (role-based), `ABAC` (attribute-based), or `ACL` (access control list). Default: `RBAC`
- `{{conditions}}` — optional: contextual conditions under which access applies (e.g., "only during business hours", "only from internal network")
**Output**: a single `permission` artifact at `p09_perm_`{{scope_slug}}`.md` with read/write/execute rules, role hierarchy, allow_list, deny_list, audit config, and escalation path.
**Boundaries**: handles access control rules only. Does NOT define safety constraints that limit what a system CAN do regardless of permission (use guardrail-builder), operational laws that are inviolable (use invariant-builder), or quality thresholds (use quality_gate-builder).
## Phases
### Phase 1: RESEARCH
**Goal**: Identify the full access landscape — scope, roles, access patterns, and existing rules — before writing.
1. Identify the `{{scope}}`: confirm it is a concrete resource, artifact, or agent. A scope that is too broad ("the whole system") must be split into multiple permission artifacts.
2. Find existing permissions for the same scope: search `P09_config/examples/` or use brain_query [IF MCP]: `permission {{scope}}`. If found, determine whether an update or merge is needed.
3. Enumerate all roles from `{{roles}}`. For each role, determine:
   - What operations they need: `read`, `write`, `execute`
   - Whether access is unconditional or conditional (see `{{conditions}}`)
   - Whether this role inherits from a parent role (role hierarchy)
4. Identify the access model from `{{access_model}}`:
   - `RBAC`: permissions attached to roles, roles assigned to principals
   - `ABAC`: permissions evaluated against resource/subject attributes at runtime
   - `ACL`: explicit list of principals with their allowed operations per resource
5. Determine deny precedence rule: deny_list entries ALWAYS override allow_list entries. Document this explicitly.
6. Identify what must be logged for audit: at minimum, log all `write` and `execute` operations with principal identity, timestamp, and resource identifier.
7. Identify the escalation path: how does a principal request elevated access that they do not currently hold?
**Exit**: all roles mapped to operations, access model confirmed, deny precedence rule documented, audit log requirements identified, escalation path known.
### Phase 2: COMPOSE
**Goal**: Produce all artifact fields and body sections following SCHEMA.md and OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md.
8. Read SCHEMA.md — source of truth for all required fields (17 required + 4 recommended).
9. Read OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md — fill `{{vars}}` following SCHEMA constraints exactly.
10. Generate `scope_slug` in snake_case. Set `id = p09_perm_`{{scope_slug}} matching `^p09_perm_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$`.
11. Fill frontmatter: all 17 required + 4 recommended fields. Set `quality: null` — never self-score.
12. Set `scope` to the concrete resource or artifact being protected.
13. Define **read rules**: who can view the scope and under what conditions. For conditional access, state the condition explicitly.
14. Define **write rules**: who can modify the scope and under what conditions. Write access implies read access unless explicitly denied.
15. Define **execute rules**: who can run or invoke the scope and under what conditions. Only include if `execute` is in `{{operations}}`.
16. Define the **role hierarchy**: list each role and its parent role (if any). A child role inherits all permissions of its parent unless explicitly overridden.
17. Write **allow_list**: explicit role-operation pairs that are permitted. Format: `role: [operation_1, operation_2]`.
18. Write **deny_list**: explicit role-operation pairs that are forbidden. Format: `role: [operation_1]`. Deny overrides allow — document this precedence.
19. Write **audit** section: what gets logged (operation, principal, timestamp, resource ID), where logs are sent, retention period.
20. Write **escalation** section: how to request elevated access — process (ticket, approval chain), approver role, time limit for temporary elevation.
**Exit**: read/write/execute rules defined for all roles in `{{roles}}`, deny_list precedence documented, audit section complete.
### Phase 3: VALIDATE
**Goal**: Verify all quality gates and precedence rules before writing the final artifact.
21. Check QUALITY_GATES.md — verify HARD gates: id format, kind, pillar, quality==null, scope present.
22. Verify deny_list overrides allow_list (precedence correct) — this must be stated explicitly in the artifact body.
