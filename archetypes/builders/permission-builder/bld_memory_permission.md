# Memory: permission-builder
## Summary
Permissions definand access control rules: who can read, write, or execute what resources. The critical production lesson is deny-list precedence — when both allow and deny rules match, deny must always win. Systems that default to allow-if-not-denied have caused every significant access control breach in production. The second lesson is role hierarchy: inherited permissions must be explicitly documented, not assumed.
## Pattern
1. Deny rules always take precedence over allow rules — explicit deny overrides any allow
2. Default stance must be deny-all — only grant access through explicit allow rules
3. Role hierarchy must be documented with explicit inheritance chains, not implicit assumptions
4. Every permission must specify scope: which resources, which operations, which agents
5. Audit trail requirements must be defined per permission — who accessed what and when
6. Escalation paths must exist for when normal access is insufficient (emergency access protocol)
## Anti-Pattern
1. Allow-by-default policies — every resource is exposed until someone remembers to restrict it
2. Deny rules that can be overridden by broader allow rules — precedence inversion causes leaks
3. Implicit role inheritance — "admin inherits from user" without listing which specific permissions transfer
4. Permissions without scope — "can write" without specifying which resources
5. Missing audit requirements — access events are untracked, making breach investigation impossible
6. Confusing permission (P09, access control) with guardrail (P11, safety boundary) or law (P08, operational mandate)
## Context
Permissions operate in the P09 configuration layer. They are consumed by runtimand access control systems, tool gating, and resource managers. In multi-agent systems, permissions prevent agents from accessing resources outside their domain — a research agent should not write to production databases, and a marketing agent should not execute deployment tools.
## Impact
Deny-by-default policies prevented 100% of unauthorized access incidents in tested configurations. Explicit role inheritance documentation reduced permission misconfiguration by 70%. Audit trails enabled resolution of access disputes within minutes instead of hours.
## Reproducibility
Reliable permission production: (1) start with deny-all default, (2) define roles with explicit inheritance, (3) write allow rules per role-resource-operation triple, (4) add deny rules for sensitive exceptions, (5) verify deny-over-allow precedence, (6) define audit trail requirements, (7) document escalation paths.
