# Collaboration: finetune-config-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "how should this model be adapted -- which base model,
which dataset, which adapter, and which hyperparameters?"
I do not configure runtime routing. I do not document trained models. I do not define agents.
I specify training jobs so they can be handed to a framework and executed.

## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Model Adaptation Pipeline"
```
  1. knowledge-card-builder -> "document base model capabilities and limitations"
  2. finetune-config-builder -> "specify training job: adapter, dataset, hyperparameters"
  3. model-card-builder -> "document trained adapter: capabilities, eval results, usage"
  4. model-provider-builder -> "configure runtime routing to serve the adapted model"
```
### Crew: "Custom Domain Model"
```
  1. agent-builder -> "define agent persona and capabilities"
  2. finetune-config-builder -> "adapt base model to domain task"
  3. boot-config-builder -> "configure provider startup with trained adapter"
  4. benchmark-builder -> "define post-training evaluation suite"
```
### Crew: "Preference Alignment"
```
  1. finetune-config-builder (SFT) -> "initial supervised fine-tune on demonstrations"
  2. finetune-config-builder (reward) -> "train reward model from preference data"
  3. finetune-config-builder (RLHF/DPO) -> "align policy with reward signal"
  4. model-card-builder -> "document aligned model"
```

## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: base_model (HF model ID), task_type (sft/dpo/etc), dataset path or identifier
- optional: compute constraints (VRAM budget), quality targets, framework preference
- optional: existing finetune_config IDs to NOT duplicate

### I Produce
- finetune_config artifact (.md + .yaml frontmatter)
- committed to: `P02_model/examples/p02_ft_{name}.yaml`

### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons listed

## Builders I Depend On
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| knowledge-card-builder | Documents base model capabilities I need to understand before specifying adapter |
| dataset-builder (if exists) | Defines dataset format and field schema I reference in Dataset section |

## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| model-card-builder | Documents the trained adapter produced by running my config |
| model-provider-builder | Routes inference requests to the model I specify how to train |
| boot-config-builder | Loads the adapter I specify at provider startup |
| benchmark-builder | Evaluates the model produced by running my training config |
