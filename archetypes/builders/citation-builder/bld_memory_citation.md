observation: "Citations without excerpts are the most common failure — a URL alone provides no context if the link rots. Reliability tier misclassification (blog as tier_1) undermines trust. Missing date_accessed makes temporal validity impossible to assess."
pattern: "Always include 1-3 sentence excerpt with concrete data (numbers, dates, named entities). Classify tier_1=peer-reviewed/primary only, tier_2=official docs, tier_3=blogs/tutorials. Record date_accessed on every citation. Set quality: null always."
evidence: "Initial pattern from KC analysis — no production log yet."

## Summary
Citations ground LLM outputs in verifiable external evidence. The primary failure mode is URL-only citations without context, excerpt, or reliability assessment.
## Pattern
1. **Always excerpt** — 1-3 sentences with specific data from the source
2. **Strict tier classification** — tier_1 only for peer-reviewed/primary research
3. **Temporal tracking** — date_accessed on every citation, freshness policy when time-sensitive
4. **Relevance mapping** — specify which domains/kinds the citation supports
## Anti-Pattern
- URL-only citation: no context if URL breaks
- Blog as tier_1: overestimates reliability
- No date_accessed: cannot assess temporal validity
- No excerpt: reader must visit source to understand relevance
