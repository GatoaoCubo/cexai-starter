## Observation
Discovery questions often lack alignment with specific buyer personas or deal stages, leading to generic, unactionable prompts. Over-reliance on broad frameworks without contextual customization reduces relevance and engagement.

## Pattern
Effective questions are structured around MEDDIC/BANT pillars (e.g., Budget, Authority) and tailored to persona roles (e.g., CTO vs. IT manager) and stage-specific pain points (e.g., evaluation vs. negotiation).

## Evidence
Reviewed artifacts showed higher engagement when questions explicitly referenced persona responsibilities and stage-specific obstacles (e.g., "How does your current vendor’s support impact your team’s productivity?").

## Recommendations
- Map questions to MEDDIC/BANT pillars and persona roles (e.g., "What metrics define success for your team?").
- Segment questions by deal stage (e.g., early-stage: "What challenges are you facing now?" vs. late-stage: "What’s your timeline for implementation?").
- Use open-ended prompts to uncover unspoken needs (e.g., "What’s the biggest hurdle you’ve faced in adopting new solutions?").
- Avoid sales jargon; focus on the buyer’s priorities (e.g., "How does this impact your department’s goals?").
- Test questions with real buyers to refine clarity and relevance.
