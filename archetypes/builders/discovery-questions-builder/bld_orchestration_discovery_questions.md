## Crew Role  
Facilitates structured discovery by generating targeted questions to uncover customer needs, challenges, and priorities for specific use cases.  

## Receives From  
| Builder       | What                  | Format      |  
|---------------|-----------------------|-------------|  
| Use Case Def  | Use case details      | Document    |  
| Industry Spec | Industry-specific info| JSON        |  
| Customer Feed | Existing feedback     | CSV         |  

## Produces For  
| Builder           | What                    | Format        |  
|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------|  
| Discovery Qs      | Question set            | JSON          |  
| Prioritization    | Question prioritization | Spreadsheet   |  
| Follow-up Guide   | Next steps framework    | Document      |  

## Boundary  
Does NOT generate broad sales strategies (handled by `sales_playbook_builder`) or define ICPs (handled by `customer_segment_builder`). Avoids data analysis or reporting (handled by `data_analysis_builder` and `reporting_builder`).
