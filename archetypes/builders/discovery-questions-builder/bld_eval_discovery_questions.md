## Examples

## Golden Example
---
title: "Discovery Questions for Mid-Market SaaS Buyer (Deal Stage: Needs Analysis)"
persona: "IT Director at a mid-sized healthcare provider"
deal_stage: "Needs Analysis"
questions:
  - "What are your current challenges with patient data management in compliance with HIPAA regulations?"
  - "How many hours per week does your IT team spend manually reconciling data across systems?"
  - "What specific KPIs would you use to measure success if we implemented a cloud-based EHR solution?"
  - "Who are the key stakeholders involved in evaluating new healthcare IT solutions?"
  - "What is your current annual budget allocation for digital transformation initiatives?"

---
## Anti-Example 1: Vague and Broad Questions
questions:
  - "What are your goals for the next year?"
  - "How do you see technology impacting your business?"
  - "What challenges are you facing?"
## Why it fails: Questions lack specificity to the buyer persona (e.g., "IT Director") and deal stage (e.g., "Needs Analysis"). They are too generic to uncover actionable insights about HIPAA compliance or EHR implementation needs.

## Anti-Example 2: Sales Playbook Content
questions:
  - "Our solution reduces manual data entry by 70% – would that interest you?"
  - "We offer 24/7 support – how important is uptime to your operations?"
  - "Our competitors charge 3x more – are you looking for cost savings?"
## Why it fails: These are sales pitches disguised as discovery questions. They assume product knowledge rather than uncovering the buyer's needs, violating the MEDDIC/BANT principle of focusing on the customer's situation.
