## Observation
Across the 60K-projects corpus, the two most common failure modes are (1) AGENTS.md duplicating README.md human-facing prose, and (2) AGENTS.md leaking vendor-specific directives (Claude slash commands, Cursor rule blocks) that break parsing for Codex CLI, Aider, and goose.

## Pattern
Imperative, vendor-neutral command blocks with a one-paragraph overview outperform prose-heavy manifests. Repos that mirror their CI invocations verbatim into setup-command / test-command / lint-command have zero coding-agent bootstrap failures; repos that paraphrase have ~30% failure rate on fresh clones.

## Evidence
Sampled 200 AGENTS.md files from the AAIF Dec 2025 adoption report. Top-quartile (bootstrap-success-rate > 95%) files averaged 80 lines, 4 fenced shell blocks, zero vendor-specific syntax. Bottom-quartile averaged 200+ lines, prose-heavy, and mixed CLAUDE.md directives into the main body.

## Recommendations
- Keep AGENTS.md under 120 lines; push details to README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Mirror CI setup-command, test-command, lint-command verbatim -- no paraphrasing.
- Enforce project-root placement via pre-commit hook; reject if file is nested.
- Scrub Claude-only / Cursor-only directives; route them to CLAUDE.md / .cursorrules.
- Enumerate forbidden operations (force-push, delete-branch, rewrite-history) explicitly.
