## Crew Role
Authors the vendor-neutral AGENTS.md at project-root, synthesizing setup-command / test-command / lint-command / pr-format / deploy-rule blocks from CI reality so every AAIF-compliant coding-agent (Codex, Claude Code, Aider, Cursor, goose) can bootstrap on fresh clone.

| Builder            | What                               | Format       |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|--------------|
| N05 operations     | CI invocations + deploy-rule facts | YAML / shell |
| N04 knowledge      | Repo overview + conventions        | Markdown     |
| readme-builder     | Project summary paragraph          | Markdown     |

## Produces For
| Builder               | What                                | Format    |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------|
| Project-root          | AGENTS.md manifest                  | Markdown  |
| claude-md-builder     | Vendor-neutral baseline to extend   | Markdown  |
| cursorrules-builder   | Vendor-neutral baseline to extend   | Markdown  |
| N05 CI pipeline       | Validation target for ci_mirror_check | Markdown |

## Boundary
Does NOT author CLAUDE.md (handled by `claude_md-builder`, Claude-specific directives), README.md (handled by `readme-builder`, human-facing docs), or .cursorrules (handled by `cursorrules-builder`, Cursor-editor rules). AGENTS.md is the vendor-neutral AAIF standard; the three above are complementary vendor-specific siblings at project-root.
