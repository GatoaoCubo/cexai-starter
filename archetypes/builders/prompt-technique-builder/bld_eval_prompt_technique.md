## Quality Gate

## Definition  
(Table: metric, threshold, operator, scope)  
| metric         | threshold              | operator | scope                  |  
|----------------|------------------------|----------|------------------------|  
| Prompt Pattern | ^p03_pt_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+.md$ | matches  | Schema ID (H02)        |

## Examples

## Golden Example
```yaml
name: "Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency"
kind: prompt_technique
vendor: Anthropic
model: Claude 3.5
version: 1.0
body: |
  1. Frame the problem as a multi-step reasoning task
  2. Generate 3 independent solutions using separate reasoning paths
  3. Compare results and select the most consistent answer
  4. Use explicit markers like [Reasoning 1], [Reasoning 2] for clarity
  Example: "Solve this math problem by showing three different solution paths, then choose the most consistent answer."
```

## Anti-Example 1: Template Confusion
```yaml
name: "Generic Question Template"
kind: prompt_technique
vendor: OpenAI
model: GPT-4
version: 0.1
body: |
  "Please answer the following question: [Question here]. Provide a detailed explanation."
```
## Why it fails
This is a reusable template (prompt_template), not a specific prompting method. It lacks the structural pattern that defines a true prompt_technique.

## Anti-Example 2: Vague Instructions
```yaml
name: "Unstructured Thinking"
kind: prompt_technique
vendor: Google
model: Gemini Pro
version: 1.0
body: |
  "Think deeply about this and give a thorough answer."
```
## Why it fails
The instruction is too vague to qualify as a technique. It doesn't define a specific pattern or method for structuring the prompt, making it non-reproducible.

### H_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (HARD)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (min 3 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream or sibling reference
- Gate: REJECT if < 3 entries (auto-populated by cex_wikilink.py at F6.5)

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
