## Domain Overview
Prompt_technique refers to methods for structuring input to language models to elicit specific outputs, focusing on alignment, clarity, and control. It underpins applications in NLP, AI research, and industry use cases like chatbots, code generation, and data analysis. Techniques evolve with advancements in LLMs, emphasizing robustness against hallucination, bias, and adversarial inputs.

The field intersects with prompt engineering, a discipline formalized by OpenAI and Hugging Face, which emphasizes iterative refinement of prompts to improve model performance. Techniques are evaluated via metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and task-specific accuracy, ensuring alignment with downstream applications in healthcare, finance, and education.

## Common Patterns
1. **Chain-of-Thought**: Encourage step-by-step reasoning with explicit markers (e.g., "Reason step by step").
2. **Role Assignment**: Define a persona (e.g., "Act as a medical expert").
3. **Few-shot Examples**: Include 2–5 examples to guide task-specific outputs.
4. **Retrieval-Augmented Queries**: Integrate external data via database links or APIs.
5. **Counterfactual Prompts**: Test robustness with hypothetical scenarios (e.g., "What if X were false?").

## Pitfalls
- Over-reliance on few-shot examples without validation.
- Ignoring alignment risks (e.g., bias, hallucination).
- Overfitting prompts to narrow use cases, reducing generalizability.
- Poorly formatted prompts leading to ambiguous outputs.
- Neglecting evaluation with domain-specific metrics.
