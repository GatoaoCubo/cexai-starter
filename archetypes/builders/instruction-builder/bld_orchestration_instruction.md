# Collaboration: instruction-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "what are the exact steps to execute this task?"
I do not define agent identity. I do not write task prompts with I/O.
I compose step-by-step recipes so agents can execute tasks in correct order with validation.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "New Agent End-to-End"
```
  1. knowledge-card-builder -> "domain knowledge"
  2. agent-builder -> "agent definition"
  3. instruction-builder -> "execution steps for agent tasks"
  4. boot-config-builder -> "provider configuration"
  5. agent-package-builder -> "deployable package"
```
### Crew: "Task Recipe Design"
```
  1. context-doc-builder -> "domain context for grounding"
  2. instruction-builder -> "step-by-step operational recipe"
  3. action-prompt-builder -> "task prompt that follows the recipe"
  4. e2e-eval-builder -> "end-to-end test of recipe execution"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: task name, high-level goal, execution environment
- optional: prerequisites, rollback procedures, validation criteria, dependencies
### I Produce
- instruction artifact (.md + .yaml frontmatter)
- committed to: `cex/P03/examples/p03_instruction_{task}.md`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons
## Builders I Depend On
- context-doc-builder: provides domain background that grounds recipe steps
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| action-prompt-builder | Prompts may implement instruction steps |
| chain-builder | Chains may encode instruction sequences as prompt pipelines |
| handoff-builder | Embeds instruction steps in delegation packages |
| agent-package-builder | Includes instructions in agent packages |
