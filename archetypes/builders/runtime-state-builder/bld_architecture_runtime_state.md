# Architecture: runtime_state in the CEX
## Component Inventory
| Name | Role | Owner | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| frontmatter block | Metadata header (id, kind, pillar, domain, target_agent, persistence_scope, etc.) | runtime-state-builder | active |
| routing_rules | Active routing decisions accumulated during runtime | agent | active |
| decision_history | Log of decisions made with context and outcomes | agent | active |
| priorities | Current priority ordering that may shift during execution | agent | active |
| heuristics | Runtime-adapted rules of thumb based on recent experience | agent | active |
| tool_preferences | Learned tool selection biases from recent success/failure | agent | active |
| state_transitions | Conditions that trigger state updates during execution | author | active |
## Dependency Graph
```
mental_model    --initializes-->  runtime_state  --consumed_by-->  agent
session_state   --feeds-->        runtime_state  --produces-->     updated_decisions
runtime_state   --signals-->      state_update
```
| From | To | Type | Data |
|------|----|------|------|
| mental_model (P02) | runtime_state | data_flow | design-time model provides initial state values |
| session_state (P10) | runtime_state | data_flow | ephemeral session data feeds runtime updates |
| runtime_state | agent (P02) | consumes | agent uses current runtime state for decisions |
| runtime_state | updated_decisions | produces | refined routing and priority decisions |
| runtime_state | state_update (P12) | signals | emitted when state transitions occur |
| learning_record (P10) | runtime_state | dependency | past learnings inform initial heuristics |
## Boundary Table
| runtime_state IS | runtime_state IS NOT |
|------------------|----------------------|
| A variable mental state accumulated during agent runtime | A design-time cognitive map (mental_model P02) |
| Contains routing rules, priorities, and heuristics that evolve | An ephemeral snapshot discarded after session (session_state P10) |
| Persists within or across sessions based on scope | A permanent record of past experience (learning_record P10) |
| Updated by state transitions triggered at runtime | A static configuration loaded once at boot |
| Scoped to one agent with specific update conditions | A search index or vector store (knowledge_index P01) |
| Reflects current operational intelligence | A historical changelog |
## Layer Map
| Layer | Components | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Initialization | mental_model, learning_record | Supply design-time defaults and past learnings |
| State | frontmatter, routing_rules, priorities, heuristics, tool_preferences | Current runtime values the agent operates with |
| Transitions | state_transitions, session_state | Define when and how state values update |
| Decisions | decision_history, updated_decisions | Record and produce routing decisions |
| Events | state_update | Signal state changes to observers |
