## Context
A **runtime_state** captures the variable mental state an agent accumulates and consults during execution. It is distinct from an agent's design-time identity (mental_model) and from ephemeral in-flight snapshots (session_state). A runtime_state contains routing rules that change based on experience, priority orderings, decision heuristics for ambiguous situations, and the domain map the agent navigates.
**Inputs**
| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `agent` | string | The agent whose state is being defined (e.g. `rag-source-builder`, `router-builder`) |
| `persistence_scope` | enum | `within_session` (reset each session) \| `cross_session` (persists across sessions) |
| `domain_map` | list | Domains this agent covers at runtime (e.g. `[llm_providers, benchmarks, tooling]`) |
| `decision_points` | list | Key decision junctions the agent encounters during execution |
**Output**
A single `.md` file with YAML frontmatter (17 required + 4 recommended fields) + body sections defining: routing_rules, decision_tree, priorities, heuristics, domain_map, tools_available, constraints, fallback, and update_triggers.
**Boundary rules**
- runtime_state = variable state the agent builds and consults during runtime (this builder)
- mental_model = design-time identity, values, and personality (different builder)
- session_state = ephemeral snapshot of a single in-flight conversation (different builder)
- learning_record = accumulated cross-session improvement patterns (different builder)
## Phases
### Phase 1: Research — Decision Mapping
Map the agent's runtime decision landscape before writing.
```
FOR the named agent:
  identify decision points:
    routing decisions:  "should I proceed or route this to another builder?"
    format decisions:   "which output structure fits this input?"
    scope decisions:    "is this within my domain or a boundary case?"
    tool decisions:     "which tool best serves this step?"
  FOR each decision point:
    map the branch conditions (IF x THEN y ELSE z)
    identify what signals trigger each branch (input features, context flags)
    note what happens at each leaf (action, route, error)
  priorities: what does this agent optimize for, in strict order?
    example: correctness > completeness > brevity > speed
  heuristics: rules of thumb for situations where the decision tree is ambiguous
    example: "when domain is unclear, prefer the narrower scope over the broader"
  tools_available: which tools can this agent invoke during execution?
    list tool names + one-line description of when each is used
  constraints: what limits apply to this agent's runtime behavior?
    example: max retries, forbidden actions, required audit steps
  update_triggers: what events cause this state to be updated?
    example: "after each successful artifact delivery", "on schema version change"
Check brain_query [IF MCP] for existing runtime_states for the same agent.
Generate state_slug: snake_case, matches agent name pattern.
```
Deliverable: decision map with branches, priorities, heuristics, and update triggers.
### Phase 2: Classify — Boundary Check
Confirm the artifact belongs to `runtime_state` and not a sibling kind.
```
IF the artifact defines the agent's identity, personality, or design-time values:
  RETURN "Route to mental-model-builder — that defines what the agent IS, not its runtime state."
IF the artifact captures a snapshot of a single in-flight conversation:
  RETURN "Route to session-state-builder — that is ephemeral, not accumulated state."
IF the artifact records patterns learned across many sessions for future improvement:
  RETURN "Route to learning-record-builder."
IF the artifact defines routing, decision logic, priorities, and heuristics that the
  agent consults and may update during execution:
  PROCEED as runtime_state
```
Deliverable: confirmed `kind: runtime_state` with one-line justification.
### Phase 3: Compose — Build the State Artifact
Assemble frontmatter and body following SCHEMA.md and OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md.
```
ID generation:
  id = "p10_rs_" + state_slug
  state_slug typically mirrors the agent slug (e.g. p10_rs_router_builder)
Frontmatter (17 required + 4 recommended fields from SCHEMA.md):
  Required: id, kind (= runtime_state), pillar (= P10), title, version,
            created, updated, author, agent, persistence_scope,
            domain_map (list), priorities (ordered list),
            tools_available (list), constraints (list),
            fallback, update_triggers, quality (= null)
  Recommended: tags, tldr, keywords, density_score
Body structure (all sections required):
  ## Routing Rules
  How the agent routes incoming requests at runtime.
  Format as a decision table or IF/THEN list:
    IF {signal or condition}: ROUTE TO {destination or action}
    IF {signal or condition}: PROCEED with {approach}
  Each rule must be concrete and actionable — no abstract directives.
  ## Decision Tree
  Branch logic for the agent's key decision points.
  Format as nested conditions with explicit leaf outcomes:
    root condition
