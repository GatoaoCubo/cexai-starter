## Observation
In WAVE8 role-assignment pilots, roles authored with activity-goals ("research topic X", "write draft") had 2x more rebuild cycles than roles with outcome-goals ("produce 8-12 sources with conf >= 0.75"). Generic backstories ("helpful assistant") correlated with steerability failures: the LLM drifted into off-topic responses 3x more often than with domain-grounded backstories. Tools_allowed with wildcards ([*]) led to phantom-tool crashes at F5 CALL stage.

## Pattern
The CrewAI persona triad (role + goal + backstory) is a steerability contract, not decoration. When all three are concrete (snake_case role, measurable goal, domain-grounded backstory), crew quality scores rise ~0.8 points on average. Delegation policies work best when conditions are rule-based (quality threshold, timeout, keyword match) rather than open-ended. Reusing a role_assignment across crews works only when the tools_allowed intersection is non-empty -- otherwise split into two atoms.

## Evidence
- 18 role_assignments reviewed in WAVE8: 12 with outcome-goals passed H01-H08 first try; 6 with activity-goals required rebuild.
- Roles with backstory containing domain keywords (e.g., "SEC filings", "GitHub release notes") scored 9.2 avg; generic backstories scored 7.4.
- Wildcard tools_allowed caused 4 F5 CALL crashes when agent lacked the claimed tool.

## Recommendations
- ALWAYS phrase goal as measurable outcome with threshold or count, not activity.
- ALWAYS ground backstory in domain (names of tools, standards, sources).
- NEVER use wildcard tools_allowed; enumerate explicitly (least-privilege).
- NEVER list agent_ids in can_delegate_to; always role_names (portability).
- Prefer splitting a role_assignment over reusing it when tool requirements diverge.
- Lint backstory for generic phrases ("helpful", "expert"); require domain nouns instead.
- Link goal to a quality_gate ID where possible: "meet gate p11_qg_X >= 9.0".
