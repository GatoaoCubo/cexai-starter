## Crew Role
Acts as the atomic role-binding unit consumed by crew_template. Upstream from crew-template-builder (composition) and supervisor-builder (runtime instantiation). Sibling to agent-builder (provides identity source) and toolkit-builder (provides native tool set).

## Receives From
| Builder                   | What                              | Format            |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| agent-builder             | agent_id registry path + manifest | .claude/agents/*.md |
| toolkit-builder           | Agent's native toolkit (source)   | yaml tool list    |
| N07 orchestrator          | Role scoping hints (goal, domain) | handoff frontmatter |
| crew-template-builder     | Target crew context (constraints) | p12_ct_*.md       |

## Produces For
| Builder                   | What                             | Format            |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| crew-template-builder     | Atomic role_assignment reference | p02_ra_*.md       |
| supervisor-builder        | Runtime-ready role spec          | compiled yaml     |
| workflow-builder          | Role step identity for workflows | artifact ref      |
| agent-package-builder     | Role binding in distributable pkg| bundled artifact  |

## Boundary
Does NOT define agent identity (that is agent-builder's job). Does NOT compose the full crew blueprint (crew-template-builder does). Does NOT execute the role at runtime (supervisor-builder handles spawn). Does NOT provide the underlying toolkit (toolkit-builder owns that). Owns ONLY the binding tuple: (role_name, agent_id, responsibilities, tools_allowed, delegation_policy, backstory, goal).
