## ID Pattern
Regex: `^p07_judge_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$`
Rule: id MUST equal filename stem.
## Body Structure (required sections)
1. `## Overview` — what the judge evaluates, use case, who/what is being judged
2. `## Criteria` — each criterion: name, definition, what high/low scores mean
3. `## Scale` — scale type, anchor labels, how to assign scores
4. `## Few-Shot Examples` — 2+ calibrated examples with input, score, rationale
## Constraints
- max_bytes: 2048 (body only — judge spec with calibration examples)
- naming: p07_judge_{slug}.md (single file)
- machine_format: yaml (compiled artifact)
- id == filename stem
- criteria list MUST match criterion names defined in ## Criteria section
- quality: null always
- NO implementation code in body — spec only
- few_shot examples MUST use the declared scale range
