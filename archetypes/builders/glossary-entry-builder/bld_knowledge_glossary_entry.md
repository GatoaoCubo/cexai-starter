# Domain Knowledge: glossary_entry
## Executive Summary
Glossary entries are concise, authoritative term definitions: one term, one definition, maximum clarity. They follow ISO 1087 terminology science — each entry defines a single term with synonyms, abbreviations, disambiguation, and usage context. Glossary entries differ from knowledge cards (dense multi-fact research), context docs (domain background), and axioms (immutable rules).
## Spec Table
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Pillar | P01 (knowledge) |
| Frontmatter fields | 15+ |
| Quality gates | 7 HARD + 8 SOFT |
| Max definition length | 3 lines |
| Scope | One term per entry (atomic) |
| Key fields | term, definition, synonyms, abbreviations, disambiguation |
## Patterns
- **Concise definitions**: max 3 lines — no prose padding, no extended explanation
- **One term per entry**: atomic; never cluster related concepts in a single entry
- **Explicit synonyms**: list all known alternatives, even partial matches
- **Abbreviation linking**: full form and short form always cross-referenced
- **Disambiguation**: clarify when similar terms exist — which meaning applies in this domain
- **Usage context**: where and how the term appears in forctice, not abstract definition only
| Source | Concept | Application |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| ISO 1087 | Term/concept/designation science | term + definition + synonyms |
| IEEE Glossary | Technical term standardization | Domain-specific definitions |
| W3C Glossary | Web standards terminology | Cross-references and abbreviations |
| Wikipedia | Disambiguation pages | disambiguation field |
## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why it fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| Multi-paragraph definition | Glossary is not a knowledge card; keep to 3 lines |
| Multiple terms in one entry | Not atomic; split into separate entries |
| Missing synonyms | Users search by different names; synonyms enable discovery |
| No disambiguation | Confused with similar terms in other domains |
| No usage context | Definition is abstract; readers don't know where it applies |
| Abbreviation without expansion | Acronym soup; always link full and short forms |
## Application
1. Identify term: one specific term to define
2. Write definition: max 3 lines, concrete, no padding
3. List synonyms: all known alternatives including partial matches
4. Document abbreviations: full form ↔ short form linkage
5. Add disambiguation: clarify against similar terms
6. Specify usage: where and how the term appears in forctice
