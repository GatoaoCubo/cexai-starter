# Config: glossary_entry Production Rules
## Naming Convention
| Scope | Convention | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Artifact files | `p01_gl_{term_slug}.yaml` | `p01_gl_kind.yaml` |
| Builder directory | kebab-case | `glossary-entry-builder/` |
| Frontmatter fields | snake_case | `related_terms`, `domain_specific` |
| Term slugs | snake_case, lowercase | `kind`, `knowledge_card`, `quality_gate` |
Rule: id MUST equal filename stem.
## File Paths
1. Output: `cex/P01_knowledge/examples/p01_gl_{term_slug}.yaml`
2. Compiled: `cex/P01_knowledge/compiled/p01_gl_{term_slug}.yaml`
## Size Limits (aligned with SCHEMA)
1. Body: max 512 bytes
2. Total: ~800 bytes including frontmatter
3. Definition: max 3 lines
4. Density: >= 0.80
## Definition Rules
| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| Max 3 lines | HARD (H07) |
| No filler words | SOFT (S07) |
| Concrete, not abstract | SOFT (S05) |
| Include at least one example in definition | SOFT (S04) |
## Term Conventions
1. Terms are lowercase unless proper noun
2. Multi-word terms use snake_case in id, natural case in term field
3. Abbreviations documented in abbreviation field
4. Cross-pillar terms include pillar reference in disambiguation
