## Component Inventory
| Name | Role | Owner | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| term | The canonical name of the domain concept being defined | glossary_entry | required |
| definition | Concise explanation of the term; max 3 lines | glossary_entry | required |
| domain | Subject area that scopes the term's meaning | glossary_entry | required |
| synonyms | Alternative names or abbreviations for the same concept | glossary_entry | optional |
| related_terms | Other glossary entries that share conceptual proximity | glossary_entry | optional |
| disambiguation | Clarification when the term overlaps with a similar concept | glossary_entry | conditional |
| usage_context | Short note on where or how the term appears in forctice | glossary_entry | optional |
## Dependency Graph
```
knowledge_card (P01) --produces--> glossary_entry
glossary_entry       --produces--> system_prompt (P03)
glossary_entry       --produces--> context_doc (P01)
knowledge_index (P10)    --depends-->  glossary_entry
```
| From | To | Type | Data |
|------|----|------|------|
| knowledge_card (P01) | glossary_entry | produces | source concepts requiring concise term definitions |
| glossary_entry | system_prompt (P03) | data_flow | term definitions injected for LLM terminology grounding |
| glossary_entry | context_doc (P01) | data_flow | term references embedded in domain context documents |
| knowledge_index (P10) | glossary_entry | depends | indexes entries for fast lookup and semantic search |
## Boundary Table
| glossary_entry IS | glossary_entry IS NOT |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| A short definition of one domain term (max 3 lines) | A deep knowledge distillation with density scoring |
| The smallest knowledge unit — single-term scope | A context document explaining a full domain or system |
| A lookup artifact for quick terminology reference | An input/output demonstration pair for format teaching |
| Allowed to list synonyms and related terms | A naming convention rule that enforces identifier patterns |
| Scoped to one term with optional disambiguation | An immutable operational rule that governs system behavior |
| Indexed for search and referenced by other knowledge artifacts | An evaluation artifact with quality scores or assertions |
## Layer Map
| Layer | Components | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Source | knowledge_card (P01) | Provide source concepts that need term-level definitions |
| Core | term, definition, domain | The essential triad — name, meaning, and scope |
| Enrichment | synonyms, related_terms, disambiguation, usage_context | Improve discoverability and reduce ambiguity |
| Index | knowledge_index (P10) | Make the entry searchable across the knowledge system |
| Consumption | system_prompt (P03), context_doc (P01) | Inject terminology into LLM context and domain documents |
