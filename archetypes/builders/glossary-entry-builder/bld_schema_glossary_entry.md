## ID Pattern
Regex: `^p01_gl_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$`
Rule: id MUST equal filename stem.
## Body Structure (required sections)
1. `## Definition` — the concise definition (max 3 lines)
2. `## Usage` — where and how the term appears
3. `## Disambiguation` — clarification vs similar terms (if needed)
4. `## Related Terms` — cross-references to other glossary entries
## Constraints
- max_bytes: 512 (body only)
- max_definition_lines: 3
- naming: p01_gl_{term}.yaml
- machine_format: yaml
- id == filename stem
- definition MUST be <= 3 lines
- synonyms MUST have at least 1 entry
- quality: null always
- glossary_entry is CONCISE — no deep analysis (that is knowledge_card)
