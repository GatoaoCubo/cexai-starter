## Quality Gate

# Gate: glossary_entry
## Definition
| Field     | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| metric    | composite score across SOFT dimensions |
| threshold | >= 7.0 to publish; >= 9.5 for golden |
| operator  | weighted average after all HARD gates pass |
| scope     | all artifacts where `kind: glossary_entry` |
All HARD gates are AND-logic: one failure rejects the artifact regardless of SOFT score.
## HARD Gates
| ID  | Check | Fail Condition |
|-----|-------|----------------|
| H01 | Frontmatter parses as valid YAML | Any YAML syntax error |
| H02 | ID matches `^p01_gl_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$` | Wrong format or namespace |
| H03 | ID equals filename stem (no extension) | Mismatch between id field and file name |
| H04 | Kind equals literal `glossary_entry` | Any other value |
| H05 | `quality` field is null | Any non-null value |
| H06 | Required fields present: id, kind, pillar, version, created, updated, author, term, domain, quality, tags, tldr | Any missing field |
## SOFT Scoring
| Dim | Dimension | Weight | Scoring Guide |
|-----|-----------|--------|---------------|
| S01 | `tldr` IS the definition (not meta-commentary about the entry) | 0.12 | Is the definition=1.0, meta-comment=0.2 |
| S02 | Tags list len >= 3, includes `glossary` | 0.05 | Met=1.0, partial=0.5 |
| S03 | Definition section present in body (not just frontmatter) | 0.10 | Present=1.0, absent=0.0 |
| S04 | Definition includes a concrete usage example | 0.10 | Present=1.0, absent=0.0 |
| S05 | `term` is lowercase unless it is a proper noun | 0.05 | Correct=1.0, wrong case=0.3 |
| S06 | Disambiguation section present and references at least one similar term | 0.12 | Present+reference=1.0, absent=0.0 |
**Weight sum: 1.00**
## Actions
| Score | Action |
|-------|--------|
| >= 9.5 | GOLDEN — reference artifact for glossary_entry calibration |
| >= 8.0 | PUBLISH — pool-eligible; definition concise and disambiguated |
| >= 7.0 | REVIEW — usable but missing usage example or disambiguation |
| < 7.0  | REJECT — redo; likely circular definition, oversized, or no synonyms |
## Bypass
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| conditions | Term is a proper noun (product name, acronym) where synonyms are genuinely N/A |
| approver | Domain owner who manages the target glossary namespace |
| audit trail | Required: justification for N/A synonyms, glossary namespace, approver name |
| expiry | Permanent; terminology bypass does not expire |
| never bypass | H01 (corrupt YAML), H05 (self-scored quality invalid), H07 (3-line limit is the defining constraint of this kind — bypass makes it a knowledge_card) |

## Examples

# Examples: glossary-entry-builder
## Golden Example
INPUT: "Define o termo 'kind' no context do CEX"
OUTPUT:
```yaml
id: p01_gl_kind
kind: glossary_entry
pillar: P01
version: "1.0.0"
created: "2026-03-26"
updated: "2026-03-26"
author: "builder"
term: "kind"
definition: "The artifact type identifier in CEX. Each kind belongs to one pillar and has a unique schema, naming convention, and builder. Examples: knowledge_card, validator, signal."
synonyms: [type, artifact_type]
abbreviation: null
domain: "cex-taxonomy"
domain_specific: "In CEX, kind replaces 'type' to avoid language keyword conflicts and clarify artifact classification."
context: "Used in every artifact frontmatter as the kind field, in TAXONOMY_LAYERS.yaml, and in _schema.yaml files."
disambiguation: "kind is the CEX-specific term. 'type' is the generic programming concept. 'type_def' (P06) is a different artifact that defines costm types."
related_terms: [pillar, layer, artifact, type_def]
usage: "Set kind: glossary_entry in frontmatter. Route via brain_query using kind filter."
quality: 8.8
tags: [glossary, cex-taxonomy, kind, terminology]
tldr: "kind = artifact type identifier in CEX. Belongs to one pillar, has unique schema and builder."
```
## Definition
The artifact type identifier in CEX. Each kind belongs to one pillar and has a unique
schema, naming convention, and builder. Examples: knowledge_card, validator, signal.
## Usage
Set `kind: glossary_entry` in frontmatter. Route via `brain_query` using kind filter.
Every artifact MUST declare its kind. TAXONOMY_LAYERS.yaml lists all 69 kinds.
## Disambiguation
- **kind** vs **type**: kind is CEX-specific; type is generic programming concept
- **kind** vs **type_def**: type_def (P06) defines costm types; kind classifies artifacts
## Related Terms
- pillar: the domain a kind belongs to (P01-P12)
- layer: the functional layer (spec, content, prompt, runtime, governance)
- artifact: any CEX-produced output identified by kind
WHY THIS IS GOLDEN:
- quality: null (H05 pass)
- id matches p01_gl_ pattern (H02 pass)
- kind: glossary_entry (H04 pass)
- 13+ required fields present (H06 pass)

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
