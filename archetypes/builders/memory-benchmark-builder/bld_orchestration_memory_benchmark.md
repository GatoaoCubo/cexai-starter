## Crew Role  
Generates and validates memory-specific benchmark tests, ensuring alignment with evaluation criteria and data integrity.  

## Receives From  
| Builder       | What                  | Format  |  
|---------------|-----------------------|---------|  
| scenario_gen | Test scenarios        | JSON    |  
| config_mgr    | Memory config params  | YAML    |  
| data_prov     | Synthetic memory data | CSV     |  

## Produces For  
| Builder       | What                  | Format      |  
|---------------|-----------------------|-------------|  
| eval_suite    | Memory benchmark suite| JSON        |  
| report_gen    | Evaluation report     | Markdown    |  
| metrics_agg   | Performance metrics   | Parquet     |  

## Boundary  
Does NOT handle system architecture design (memory_architecture) or general-purpose benchmarks (benchmark_suite).
