## Domain Overview  
Interactive demos are critical for product onboarding, marketing, and training, enabling users to explore features through guided scenarios. Unlike in-app tours, they operate as standalone experiences, often embedded in websites or external platforms. Success hinges on balancing instructional clarity with engagement, leveraging storytelling, and aligning with user goals. Key challenges include maintaining narrative flow, ensuring technical reliability, and adapting to diverse user contexts.  

## Key Concepts  
| Concept                | Definition                                                                 | Source                                  |  
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|  
| User Journey Mapping  | Visualizing user interactions and decision points within the demo         | Nielsen Norman Group (2018)           |  
| Script Branching      | Conditional navigation based on user input or choices                     | Interactive Fiction Tech Foundation   |  
| Talk Track            | Pre-recorded or live narration synchronized with demo steps               | UX Design Patterns (2020)             |  
| State Persistence     | Saving user progress across demo sessions                                 | ISO/IEC 25010 (Quality Attributes)    |  
| Accessibility Layers  | Inclusive design elements (e.g., screen readers, keyboard navigation)    | W3C CUI Guidelines (2021)             |  
| Performance Metrics   | KPIs like completion rate, drop-off points, and engagement time          | IEEE 12207 (Software Lifecycle)       |  
| Modular Components    | Reusable demo segments for scalability and maintenance                   | Component-Based UI Design (2019)      |  
| Analytics Integration | Embedding tracking to measure user behavior and demo effectiveness      | Google Analytics for Firebase         |  

## Platform Patterns (Demo Platforms)
| Platform | Model | Key Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Demostack | HTML-cloned sandbox | Full product replica; sales team customizes per prospect |
| Reprise | Live-capture overlay | Record prod UI; add branching overlays on top |
| Navattic | No-code click-through | Screenshot-based; embed in website/email |
| Arcade | Screenshot walkthroughs | Fastest to build; best for top-of-funnel |
| Supademo | Screenshot + annotation | Built-in analytics on step drop-off |

## Presales SE Playbook Structure
A demo script is not a feature tour. It follows a sales narrative:
1. **Discovery** -- confirm pain points before showing product
2. **Setup** -- position the demo context ("Let me show you how X solves Y")
3. **Core demo** -- 3-5 features maximum, each tied to a discovered pain
4. **Proof** -- customer reference, metric, or third-party validation
5. **Objection handling** -- pre-planned responses to common pushback
6. **CTA** -- clear next step (trial, POC, follow-up call)

## Industry Standards
- MEDDIC / MEDDPIC qualification framework (demo targeting)
- W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)
- Presales Collective best practices (talk track templates)
- Challenger Sale methodology (teach-tailor-take-control)
- ISO/IEC 25010:2011 (quality attributes for interactive systems)  

## Common Patterns  
1. Linear progression: Sequential steps with minimal user choice.  
2. Branching scenarios: Conditional paths based on user decisions.  
3. Multimedia integration: Combining video, audio, and interactive elements.  
4. Accessibility-first design: Prioritizing keyboard navigation and screen reader support.  
5. Micro-interactions: Feedback mechanisms for user actions.  

## Pitfalls  
- Overloading demos with too many features, causing cognitive overload.  
- Ignoring user feedback loops during demo creation.  
- Inconsistent pacing between scripted steps, leading to disengagement.  
- Poor localization for non-English audiences.  
- Lack of analytics to measure demo effectiveness.
