## Examples

## Golden Example
---
title: "Notion Interactive Demo for Project Management"
kind: interactive_demo
---
**Step 1: Welcome**
- Action: Open Notion workspace
- Talk Track: "Welcome! Today, we'll explore how Notion streamlines project management."

**Step 2: Create a New Page**
- Action: Click "New Page" > Select "Project Template"
- Talk Track: "Here's a pre-built template. Customize it with your team's workflow."

**Step 3: Add Tasks**
- Action: Drag "Task" block into the page
- Talk Track: "Add tasks here. Use checkboxes for progress tracking."

**Step 4: Collaborate**
- Action: Invite team via email
- Talk Track: "Real-time collaboration is enabled. See edits as they happen."

**Step 5: Wrap-Up**
- Action: Save and share the page
- Talk Track: "That's it! Your team now has a centralized hub for projects."

## Anti-Example 1: Missing Guided Steps
---
**Step 1: Welcome**
- Talk Track: "Welcome to our demo! Let's see how this works."
---
## Why it fails
No actionable steps or structure. The demo lacks a clear tour path, making it unguided and confusing for users.

## Anti-Example 2: Placeholder Vendors
---
**Step 1: Welcome**
- Action: Use "ProviderA's tool"
- Talk Track: "ProviderA's tool helps with X. Let's see how."
---
## Why it fails
Uses generic vendor names instead of real tools. This reduces credibility and makes the demo feel generic, not tailored to actual products.

### H_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (HARD)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (min 3 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream or sibling reference
- Gate: REJECT if < 3 entries (auto-populated by cex_wikilink.py at F6.5)

### S_RELATED: Cross-Reference Check (SOFT)
- [ ] `related:` frontmatter field populated (3-15 entries)
- [ ] `## Related Artifacts` section present in artifact body
- [ ] At least 1 upstream and 1 downstream reference
- Penalty: -0.3 if empty (does not block, encourages wiring)
