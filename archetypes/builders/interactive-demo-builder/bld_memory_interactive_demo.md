## Observation
Common issues include inconsistent step numbering, mismatched talk track timing, and unclear user goals in demo scripts. Overlooking device-specific interaction nuances often leads to incomplete walkthroughs.

## Pattern
Effective scripts use numbered steps with explicit user actions, paired with concise talk tracks that mirror user intent. Aligning demo flows with product onboarding reduces confusion during testing.

## Evidence
Reviewed artifacts showed 30% fewer errors when steps included both visual and verbal cues, as seen in the "Analytics Dashboard" demo.

## Recommendations
- Use sequential numbering and label steps with clear user actions (e.g., "Click 'Export'").
- Sync talk track timing with UI transitions to avoid misalignment.
- Define user goals upfront (e.g., "Help user export data in 3 steps").
- Test demos on multiple devices to catch interaction gaps.
- Keep talk tracks under 15 seconds per step to maintain engagement.
