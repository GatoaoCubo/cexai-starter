Creates interactive demo scripts by integrating user stories, technical specs, and design assets into cohesive, executable demo flows. Acts as a bridge between content creators and engineers.  

## Receives From  
| Builder | What | Format |  
|---|---|---|  
| Content Writer | Script outline & user flows | Markdown |  
| Design Team | Visual assets & UI components | ZIP (images, Figma files) |  
| Engineering Team | Technical constraints & API specs | JSON (schema, endpoints) |  

## Produces For  
| Builder | What | Format |  
|---|---|---|  
| Content Writer | Demo script with annotated interactions | Markdown |  
| Engineering Team | Interactive element definitions | JSON (event handlers, state logic) |  
| QA Team | Demo preview link & test scenarios | URL + CSV (test cases) |  

## Boundary  
Does NOT handle hosting/deployment (DevOps), user testing (QA Team), or asset storage management (Design Team).
