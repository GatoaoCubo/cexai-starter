## Architectural Position
interactive_demo is a P05 output builder producing self-serve guided-tour scripts and talk tracks. It occupies the self-serve evaluation layer: after pitch_deck closes the deal conceptually, interactive_demo lets buyers explore the product independently. The presales SE playbook (talk track + objection map) is the primary structural reference.
