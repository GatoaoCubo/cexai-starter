# Collaboration: context-window-config-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "how should the context window budget be allocated?"
I do not write prompts. I do not define agent identity. I do not specify model capabilities.
I ensure every prompt component has an allocated budget within model limits.
## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Prompt Assembly Pipeline"
```
  1. system-prompt-builder -> "agent identity"
  2. few-shot-example-builder -> "calibration examples"
  3. context-window-config-builder -> "budget allocation for all components"
  4. prompt-template-builder -> "assembly template respecting budgets"
```
### Crew: "RAG Optimization"
```
  1. retriever-config-builder -> "retrieval parameters"
  2. context-window-config-builder -> "context budget allocation"
  3. chunk-strategy-builder -> "chunk sizes fitting budget"
```
## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: target model, workload profile, prompt component sizes
- optional: existing budgets to optimize, compression requirements
### I Produce
- context_window_config artifact (.yaml, max 2KB)
- committed to: `P03_prompt/examples/p03_cwc_{model}.yaml`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality from QUALITY_GATES)
## Builders I Depend On
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| model-card-builder | total_tokens from model spec |
## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| prompt-template-builder | Template respects allocated budgets |
| agent-card-builder | Deployment uses token limits |
| chunk-strategy-builder | Chunk sizes fit context budget |
