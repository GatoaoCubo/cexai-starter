## Summary
Context window configs allocate a model's finite context among prompt sections. The primary failure is insufficient output reserve leading to truncated responses.
## Pattern
1. **Reserve output first** — minimum 2000 tokens, typically 15-30% of total
2. **Budget proportionally** — match workload (RAG-heavy → 50% context)
3. **Priority tiers** — system prompt always protected first
4. **Validate arithmetic** — sum(budgets) + reserve <= total_tokens
## Anti-Pattern
- No output reserve: model truncates response
- Equal budgets: wastes capacity on low-priority sections
- Budget > total: impossible to assemble prompt
- Static budget for dynamic content: fixed 8K for variable RAG results
