## Observation  
Common issues include inconsistent API handling across providers, leading to redundant code, and incomplete configuration validation causing runtime failures. Misaligned sample rates or encoding formats often result in silent fallbacks.  

## Pattern  
Modular design with provider-specific adapters and shared interfaces reduces duplication. Centralized configuration validation and mock testing improve reliability during integration.  

## Evidence  
Reviewed artifacts showed 30% faster integration using abstracted STT interfaces, and 80% of runtime errors were caught via pre-deployment validation.  

## Recommendations  
- Use abstraction layers to decouple provider logic from core processing  
- Implement strict configuration schema validation for audio parameters  
- Prioritize mock testing with provider-specific edge cases  
- Document required provider credentials and environment variables  
- Enforce error propagation for API failures instead of silent drops
