observation: "Input schemas with required fields that have default values create caller confusion — callers provide the default and the system rejects it as unnecessary. Optional fields without defaults force callers to handle None unexpectedly. Using 'any' or 'object' as a type without coercion rules causes silent data corruption downstream. Informative error messages that name the failing field and expected type reduce debug time by ~60% compared to generic 'validation error' messages."
pattern: "Every field must have: type (specific, not 'any'), required (boolean), and if optional then a default value. Required fields never have defaults. Optional fields always have defaults. Coercion rules must be declared explicitly when the input type differs from the processing type (e.g., string->int). Error messages must name the field and the expected type, not just say 'invalid input'."
evidence: "8 input schema reviews: 5 of 8 had required fields with defaults (caller confusion). 6 of 8 had at least one optional field without a default (None propagation bug). 3 of 8 used 'any' type on at least one field (silent coercion failure in 2 cases). Error messages with field names reduced caller debug time from avg 12min to avg 5min."

## Summary
Input schemas define the contract between a caller and a component. The most common failure mode is semantic confusion between required and optional: a required field with a default is a contradiction, and an optional field without a default creates None propagation bugs. Getting these two rules right eliminates the majority of runtime validation failures.
## Pattern
Field definition rules (all three must hold):
1. **Type specificity** - Use `string`, `integer`, `boolean`, `list`, `object`. Never `any` or `mixed`. If the raw input type differs from the processing type, declare a coercion rule.
2. **Required/optional semantics** - `required: true` means caller must provide it, no default. `required: false` means caller may omit it, default must be declared.
3. **Error message quality** - Each field's error message must include: field name, expected type/format, and what was received. Generic messages ("validation failed") are prohibited.
Coercion rule format: `coerce: "string -> integer via int()"` — explicit source type, target type, and conversion function. Declare coercion whenever accepting loose input (e.g., form data, CLI args, LLM output).
Input schemas cover only what goes in. Do not add response shapes or output fields — that is an interface contract (different artifact type).
## Anti-Pattern
1. `required: true` with a `default` value — contradictory, creates caller confusion.
2. `required: false` with no `default` — causes None to propagate silently through processing.
3. `type: "any"` — disables type checking, causes silent coercion failures downstream.
4. Generic error message ("invalid input") — forces callers to read source code to debug.
5. Adding responsand/ortput shapes to the input schema — scope creep into interface territory.
6. Fields list as a flat string instead of structured objects — unparseable by validators.
## Context

## Builder Context

This ISO operates within the `input-schema-builder` stack, one of 125
specialized builders in the CEX architecture. Each builder has 13 ISOs
covering system prompt, instruction, output template, quality gate,
examples, schema, config, tools, memory, manifest, constraints,
validation schema, and runtime rules.

The builder loads ISOs via `cex_skill_loader.py` at pipeline stage F3
(Compose), merges them with relevant memory from `cex_memory_select.py`,
and produces artifacts that must pass the quality gate at F7 (Filter).

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| System prompt | Identity and behavioral rules |
| Instruction | Step-by-step procedure |
| Output template | Structural scaffold |
| Quality gate | Scoring rubric |
| Examples | Few-shot references |
