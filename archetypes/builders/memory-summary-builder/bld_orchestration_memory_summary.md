# Collaboration: memory-summary-builder
## My Role in Crews
I am a SPECIALIST. I answer ONE question: "how should this conversation or session be compressed, when should it fire, and what information must survive?"
I do not build ephemeral runtime snapshots. I do not define persistent learned patterns. I do not retrieve or embed summaries.
I specify memory compression artifacts so agents can extend their effective context window without ballooning token costs.

## Crew Compositions
### Crew: "Memory Stack"
```
  1. memory-summary-builder -> "compression spec (method, trigger, retention)"
  2. session-state-builder   -> "ephemeral runtime cursor (current task, tool state)"
  3. learning-record-builder -> "persistent behavioral patterns extracted from sessions"
```
### Crew: "Long-Running Agent Memory"
```
  1. memory-summary-builder  -> "sliding_window compression spec for continuous agent"
  2. retrieval-builder        -> "vector index and semantic search over stored summaries"
  3. injection-builder        -> "runtime context assembly — where and how to prepend summary"
```
### Crew: "Multi-Session Knowledge"
```
  1. memory-summary-builder  -> "cross-session compression spec (multi_session source_type)"
  2. knowledge-card-builder  -> "stable domain knowledge that never needs recompression"
  3. learning-record-builder -> "patterns extracted from compressed summaries over time"
```

## Handoff Protocol
### I Receive
- seeds: source_type, content volume estimate, fidelity requirements, retention needs
- optional: existing session_state for boundary clarification, max token budget for output
### I Produce
- memory_summary artifact (.md + .yaml frontmatter)
- committed to: `cex/P10_memory/examples/p10_summary_{scope}.md`
### I Signal
- signal: complete (with quality score from QUALITY_GATES)
- if quality < 8.0: signal retry with failure reasons

## Builders I Depend On
None — independent builder (layer 0). Memory summaries can be defined standalone without other artifacts.

## Builders That Depend On Me
| Builder | Why |
|---------|-----|
| injection-builder | Injection specs reference memory_summary artifacts as the content to prepend |
| retrieval-builder | Retrieval indexes are built over stored memory_summary outputs |
| session-state-builder | Session state may reference active memory_summary id for context chain |
| agent-builder | Agents declare which memory_summary spec governs their context compression |

## Boundary Contracts
| I hand off to | When | What I pass |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| session-state-builder | Requester needs ephemeral runtime cursor, not compression spec | Scope description + runtime fields needed |
| learning-record-builder | Requester needs to persist a behavioral pattern, not compress conversation | Pattern description + evidence |
| knowledge-card-builder | Requester needs static domain knowledge artifact, not session compression | Domain topic + knowledge type |
| retrieval-builder | Requester needs semantic search over summaries, not the summary spec itself | Summary id + embedding requirements |
