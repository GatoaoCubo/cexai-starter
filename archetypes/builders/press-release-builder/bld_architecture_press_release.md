## Dependencies

| Component | Depends on | Dependency type |
|---|---|---|
| manifest | config | reads naming convention and path config |
| instruction | system_prompt | system_prompt defines persona instruction uses |
| output_template | schema | template fields must match schema frontmatter spec |
| quality_gate | examples | golden example calibrates soft scoring dimensions |
| collaboration | memory | past pickup rate data informs handoff decisions |
| tools | external wire API | PR Newswire and BusinessWire APIs for submission |
| knowledge_card | AP Stylebook | external authority for all style decisions |
| examples | quality_gate | golden threshold (9.5) determines exemplar eligibility |

## Architectural Position

The press_release builder is the earned media production unit within CEX Pillar
P05 (Output Artifacts). It occupies a specific zone in the CEX output layer:

```
P05 Output Layer
  |
  +-- press_release builder    <-- this builder
  |     Produces: wire-ready press releases
  |     Audience: journalists, newswire systems
  |     Format: AP-style Markdown, plain text for wire
  |
  +-- blog_post builder
  |     Produces: long-form editorial content
  |     Audience: blog readers, SEO
  |
  +-- pitch_deck builder
        Produces: visual slide decks
        Audience: investors, partners
```

## Data Flow

```
Brand Team / PR Agency

  | (messaging brief, quotes, boilerplate, embargo date)
  v
press_release builder
  |
  |-- F1 CONSTRAIN: schema + config (kind, pillar, limits)
  |-- F2 BECOME: manifest + system_prompt (persona)
  |-- F3 INJECT: knowledge_card + examples + memory (context)
  |-- F4 REASON: instruction (research -> compose -> validate)
  |-- F5 CALL: tools (compile, score, AP checker)
  |-- F6 PRODUCE: output_template (wire-ready release)
  |-- F7 GOVERN: quality_gate (H01-H08 + D01-D05)
  |-- F8 COLLABORATE: collaboration (handoff to wire service)
