observation: "Diagrams without legends force readers to infer symbol meaning, increasing interpretation errors. Mixing ASCII and Mermaid notation in the same diagram breaks rendering in at least two of three target viewers. Diagrams that attempt to show all system layers in one frame become unreadable above ~12 components. Missing zoom_level forces readers to guess whether a box represents a service, a module, or a file."
pattern: "Produce diagrams in four steps: (1) choose one notation (ASCII or Mermaid) and declare zoom_level; (2) draw the visual with every component labeled and every connection annotated; (3) add a Legend section explaining every symbol used; (4) add Annotations for non-obvious relationships. Keep body under 4096 bytes by scoping tightly - split into two diagrams if needed."
evidence: "Legend-present diagrams received correct first-read interpretation in 94% of reviewer tests vs 61% for legend-absent diagrams. Single-notation diagrams rendered correctly in all three target viewers; mixed-notation diagrams broke in at least one viewer in 7 of 7 tests. Diagrams scoped to one zoom level needed 0 clarification rounds vs average 1.8 rounds for multi-level diagrams."

## Summary
Architecture diagrams fail to communicate when symbols are ambiguous, notation is inconsistent, or scope is too broad. A four-step production process - choose notation and zoom, draw labeled components, add legend, add annotations - produces diagrams that readers interpret correctly on first read without author assistance.
## Pattern
**Step 1 - Scope decision**: declare `zoom_level` (system / subsystem / component) before drawing. This forces a scope decision that determines which boxes and arrows belong. Components outside the chosen zoom level become single boxes or are omitted.
**Step 2 - Draw**: use one notation throughout. ASCII for terminal-safe artifacts; Mermaid for rendered markdown. Label every box with its name and one-line role. Annotate every arrow with the data or signal it carries. Use consistent direction (top-to-bottom for pipelines, left-to-right for request flows).
**Step 3 - Legend**: include a `## Legend` section that defines every symbol, line style, and color (or shading) used. Even standard symbols (dashed = async, solid = sync) must be stated explicitly.
**Step 4 - Annotations**: add a `## Annotations` section for decisions that cannot be shown visually - why a particular boundary exists, what a dotted line means in context, which components are optional.
**Size discipline**: if the body exceeds 4096 bytes, split into two diagrams at a natural layer boundary rather than shrinking font or removing labels.
## Anti-Pattern
1. No legend - readers infer meaning and disagree with each other.
2. Mixing ASCII boxes with Mermaid graph syntax in the same body - breaks rendering.
3. Attempting to show all layers (system + subsystem + component) in a single frame - produces unreadable clutter above ~12 nodes.
4. Unlabeled arrows - readers cannot tell whether a line means "calls", "publishes to", "inherits from", or "deploys to".
5. Prose description instead of actual visual characters - the body must contain drawn elements, not a description of what a diagram would show.
6. Missing `zoom_level` in frontmatter - consumers cannot index or filter diagrams by abstraction level.
## Context

## Builder Context

This ISO operates within the `diagram-builder` stack, one of 125
specialized builders in the CEX architecture. Each builder has 13 ISOs
covering system prompt, instruction, output template, quality gate,
examples, schema, config, tools, memory, manifest, constraints,
validation schema, and runtime rules.

The builder loads ISOs via `cex_skill_loader.py` at pipeline stage F3
(Compose), merges them with relevant memory from `cex_memory_select.py`,
and produces artifacts that must pass the quality gate at F7 (Filter).

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| System prompt | Identity and behavioral rules |
| Instruction | Step-by-step procedure |
| Output template | Structural scaffold |
| Quality gate | Scoring rubric |
| Examples | Few-shot references |

## Checklist

1. Created via 8F pipeline
2. Scored by cex_score across three layers
3. Compiled by cex_compile for validation
4. Retrieved by cex_retriever for injection
5. Evolved by cex_evolve when quality drops
