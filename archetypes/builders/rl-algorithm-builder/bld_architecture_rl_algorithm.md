## Architectural Position
rl_algorithm-builder occupies P02 (Model pillar) in the CEX taxonomy. It produces training algorithm definitions (policy optimization, exploration-exploitation rules, convergence guarantees) consumed by training pipelines and agent configurations. Upstream: reward_model (reward signal definitions). Downstream: boot_config, agent (consume trained policies).
