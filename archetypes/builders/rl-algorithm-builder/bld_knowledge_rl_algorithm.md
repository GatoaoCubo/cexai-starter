## Domain Overview  
Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms define the decision-making logic for agents interacting with environments through trial-and-error. They balance exploration and exploitation to maximize cumulative rewards, forming the core of autonomous systems, robotics, and game AI. Modern RL algorithms, such as DQN, PPO, and SAC, integrate deep learning for function approximation, enabling scalability in complex domains. These algorithms are distinct from training methods (e.g., distributed training) and reward models (e.g., shaping functions), focusing instead on policy optimization, value estimation, and environment interaction mechanics.  

## Key Concepts  
| Concept               | Definition                                                                 | Source                          |  
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|  
| Policy               | Mapping from states to actions; can be deterministic or stochastic         | Sutton & Barto (2018)          |  
| Value Function       | Expected cumulative reward from a state under a policy                    | Sutton & Barto (2018)          |  
| Q-Learning           | Off-policy algorithm estimating action-value functions                    | Watkins & Dayan (1992)         |  
| Exploration vs. Exploitation | Trade-off between trying new actions and using known optimal actions | Sutton & Barto (2018)          |  
| Discount Factor      | Weighting of future rewards (γ ∈ [0,1])                                   | Bellman (1957)                 |  
| Reward Shaping     | Modifying immediate rewards to guide learning without altering objectives | Ng et al. (1999)               |  
| Actor-Critic         | Framework combining policy (actor) and value estimation (critic)          | Konda & Borkar (2000)          |  
| Experience Replay    | Storing and sampling past experiences to break temporal correlation       | Mnih et al. (2015)             |  
| Policy Gradient      | Directly optimizing policies via gradient ascent of expected rewards      | Sutton et al. (2000)           |  
| On-policy vs. Off-policy | On-policy uses data from current policy; off-policy uses historical data | Schulman et al. (2015)         |  
| Model-Based RL       | Uses environment models to plan actions (e.g., planning with dynamics)    | Levine et al. (2020)           |  

## Industry Standards  
- OpenAI Gym (benchmark environments)  
- RLlib (Apache framework for scalable RL)  
- Stable Baselines (library for RL algorithms)  
- DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)  
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)  
- SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)  
- "Human-Level Control via Deep Reinforcement Learning" (DeepMind, 2015)  
- "Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search" (DeepMind, 2016)  

## Common Patterns  
1. Use experience replay to stabilize training in Q-learning variants.  
2. Combine policy gradients with value networks in actor-critic architectures.  
3. Apply exploration strategies like ε-greedy or entropy regularization.  
4. Use discount factors (γ) to prioritize near-term vs. long-term rewards.  
5. Leverage off-policy data for efficiency in algorithms like DQN.  
6. Integrate model-based prediction for planning in model-predictive control.  

## Pitfalls  
- Overfitting to specific environments without generalization testing.  
- Ignoring exploration, leading to suboptimal policies in sparse reward settings.  
- Improper reward shaping causing unintended agent behavior (reward hacking).  
- Neglecting partial observability in state representation design.  
- Using inappropriate discount factors that bias long-term vs. short-term goals.
