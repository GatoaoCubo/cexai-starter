## Context
A **router** artifact defines task-to-destination routing logic: given an incoming task, which agent_group, agent, or service should handle it? It contains a route table (pattern → destination mappings), confidence thresholds per route, a fallback destination for unmatched tasks, and an escalation policy for ambiguous matches.
**Inputs**
| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `routing_domain` | string | Category of tasks being routed (e.g. `agent_group_task_routing`, `intent_dispatch`) |
| `destinations` | list | All valid routing targets (agent_group names, agent IDs, or service endpoints) |
| `patterns` | list | Signals that distinguish each destination (keywords, regex, intent labels) |
| `confidence_threshold` | float | Default minimum confidence to commit to a route (0.0–1.0, default 0.7) |
| `fallback_route` | string | Destination for tasks that match no route |
**Output**
A single `.md` file with YAML frontmatter (14 required fields) + body containing: Routes table, Decision Logic, Fallback section, Escalation section, Integration section. Body must be <= 4096 bytes.
**Boundary rules**
- router = full routing logic with confidence thresholds, fallback, escalation (this builder)
- dispatch_rule = simple keyword-to-agent_group mapping without confidence scoring (different builder)
- workflow = multi-step orchestration sequence (different builder)
- agent = identity definition for a single specialized executor (different builder)
## Phases
### Phase 1: Research — Route Analysis
Map tasks to destinations and determine routing logic before writing.
```
FOR each destination in destinations:
  identify 2-5 patterns that signal "this task goes here":
    pattern types: keyword match, regex, intent label, domain tag, priority signal
  assign confidence_min per route (can vary from global default):
    critical destinations: higher threshold (e.g. 0.85)
    general destinations:  default threshold (e.g. 0.70)
  assign priority (integer, 1 = highest) for tie-breaking
Fallback route:
  SELECT one destination that handles "everything else"
  Fallback must always be a valid destination (not null, not "none")
Escalation scenarios:
  ambiguous match:   multiple routes exceed confidence_min simultaneously
  low confidence:    best match is below confidence_min for all routes
  conflict:          two routes have equal priority and equal confidence
Check brain_query [IF MCP] for existing routers in the same domain to avoid duplicates.
Generate router_slug: snake_case, lowercase, no hyphens (e.g. agent_group_task_router)
```
Deliverable: route map with patterns, confidence thresholds, priority, and fallback identified.
### Phase 2: Classify — Boundary Check
Confirm the artifact belongs to `router` and not a sibling kind.
```
IF caller needs only a simple keyword → agent_group table with no confidence scoring:
  RETURN "Route to dispatch-rule-builder — simpler artifact, no confidence logic needed."
IF caller needs a multi-step execution sequence with dependencies:
  RETURN "Route to workflow-builder — workflows orchestrate steps, not dispatch."
IF caller needs to define what an agent IS rather than where to route TO:
  RETURN "Route to agent-builder — agent identity is a different artifact kind."
IF caller needs routing logic with confidence thresholds AND fallback AND escalation:
  PROCEED as router
```
Deliverable: confirmed `kind: router` with one-line justification.
### Phase 3: Compose — Build the Router Artifact
Assemble frontmatter and all 5 required body sections following SCHEMA.md and OUTPUT_TEMPLATE.md.
```
ID generation:
  id = "p02_router_" + router_slug
  must match: ^p02_router_[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$
Frontmatter (all 14 required fields from SCHEMA.md):
  id, kind (= router), pillar (= P02), title, version,
  created, updated, author, routing_domain, destinations (list),
  fallback_route, confidence_threshold (global default),
  routes_count (must match actual route table rows), quality (= null)
Body sections (in this order):
  ## Routes
  Table: pattern | destination | priority | confidence_min
  One row per route. Pattern column: keyword list, regex, or intent label.
  Destination column: exact target name from destinations list.
  Priority column: integer (1 = highest, evaluated first on tie).
  confidence_min: per-route override, or "default" if same as global.
  routes_count in frontmatter MUST equal the number of rows in this table.
  ## Decision Logic
  Prose + pseudocode describing the routing algorithm:
    1. Evaluate all patterns against incoming task
    2. Collect routes where confidence >= confidence_min
    3. If multiple matches: select highest priority; tie-break by confidence
    4. If no match above threshold: use fallback_route
    5. If ambiguous (step 3 tie unresolvable): escalate (see Escalation)
  ## Fallback
  Destination: {fallback_route}
  Trigger condition: no pattern matches above threshold
  Behavior: what the fallback destination does with unmatched tasks
  ## Escalation
  Trigger conditions: ambiguous match, persistent low confidence, destination unavailable
  Escalation path: where to route when escalation fires
