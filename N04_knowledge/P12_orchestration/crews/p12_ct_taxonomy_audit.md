## Overview
Instantiate on a quarterly taxonomy-hygiene cadence, or whenever the kind
registry is suspected of drifting from industry standards (LangChain,
LlamaIndex, CrewAI, AutoGen, DSPy vocabularies). Producer is N04; consumers
are N03 (builder creation) and N05 (kinds_meta.json updates). Three roles run
in strict sequence; no new kind enters kinds_meta.json without a validator
PASS verdict.

## Roles
| Role | Role Assignment ID | Reason |
|------|---------------------|--------|
| gap_finder | p02_ra_gap_finder.md | Scan kinds_meta.json vs industry standards, produce ranked gap report |
| definer | p02_ra_definer.md | Write precise glossary entries for identified gaps, assign pillar |
| taxonomy_validator | p02_ra_taxonomy_validator.md | Validate entries against existing taxonomy, check overlaps/conflicts |

## Process
Topology: `sequential`. Rationale: strict dependency -- definer needs the gap
report; validator needs definer's entries. Parallelism breaks provenance and
risks premature taxonomy promotion.

## Memory Scope
| Role | Scope | Retention |
|------|-------|-----------|
| gap_finder | shared | persistent (gap_report.md saved to P01 for audit trail) |
| definer | shared | per-crew-instance (entries promoted to P01 on crew_pass) |
| taxonomy_validator | shared | persistent (validation_report.md archived to P07) |

## Handoff Protocol
`a2a-task-sequential` -- each role writes a signal under `.cex/runtime/signals/`
with `artifact_path` + `quality_score` + role metadata (`gap_count`,
`entry_count`, `crew_pass`). Next role reads prior signal before F1 CONSTRAIN.

## Success Criteria
- All 3 role deliverables exist under `.cex/runtime/crews/{instance_id}/`
- gap_finder produced >= 5 validated gaps (gap_count >= 5 in signal)
- definer produced glossary entries for all high+medium priority gaps
- validator crew_pass=true (FAIL rate <= 10% of total entries)
- Handoff signals present for 3/3 roles with no quality_score below 8.0
- No artifact produced without reading upstream output (provenance enforced)

## Instantiation
```bash
python _tools/cex_crew.py show taxonomy_audit

python _tools/cex_crew.py run taxonomy_audit \
 --charter N04_knowledge/P12_orchestration/crews/team_charter_taxonomy_audit_template.md \
 --execute
```
