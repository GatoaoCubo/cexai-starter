# Eval Dataset: N04 RAG Evaluation Question-Answer Pairs

## Purpose

Evaluation without ground truth is a compass without a map. This dataset provides:
- 50 queries with known correct answers and source references
- Coverage across 4 query types
- Baseline for MRR@10 and NDCG@10 benchmarks in `memory_benchmark_n04.md`

---

## Dataset Structure

Each entry: `query` + `ground_truth_answer` + `ground_truth_sources` (1-3 files)

## Eval Execution

No eval-running CLI flag ships with `_tools/cex_retriever.py` (verified against its
`--help` output -- the real flags are `--build`, `--query`, `--kind`, `--pillar`,
`--top-k`, `--min-score`, `--stats`, `--examples`, `--intent`, `--output`, `--verbose`;
`--output` itself selects a result FORMAT -- `json`, `table`, or `markdown` -- not a
file path, and there is no `--eval`, `--dataset`, or `--mode` flag). Score a retriever
against this dataset by calling `eval_metric_n04.md`'s `calculate_mrr()` /
`calculate_ndcg_at_k()` functions directly against `retriever.query(...)` results for
each pair above -- there is no automated benchmark harness today (see `retriever_n04.md`
Performance Targets for the same honest gap).
