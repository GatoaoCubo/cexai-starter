# Lens: Car

> Every CEX concept has a car equivalent. Use this lens when explaining to entrepreneurs, marketers, or anyone who has driven a car but never opened the hood.

## Core Mapping

| CEX Concept | Car Metaphor | One-line Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| CEX system | The car (complete vehicle) | Everything: engine, dashboard, GPS, safety systems, all working together |
| 8F pipeline | 8-step ignition-to-destination sequence | Turn key, check mirrors, select gear, navigate, drive, park, lock, report |
| 12 pillars | 12 dashboard gauges | Fuel, speed, RPM, temp, oil -- ignore one long enough and you crash |
| nucleus | Department at the dealership | Service, Sales, Parts, Finance -- each specialized, each irreplaceable |
| N07 orchestrator | Fleet manager / Dispatcher | Assigns which car goes where and who drives; never gets behind the wheel |
| kind | Part specification (part number) | "Brake pad, model X" -- defines what part, not the physical pad in your hand |
| builder | Robot on the assembly line | Each robot installs exactly one type of part; never improvises |
| ISO | Installation manual for that part | 12 pages of instructions per part type, one page per system it touches |
| artifact | Installed part / Finished component | The actual brake pad now mounted and torqued on the car |
| GDP | Pre-trip checklist with the driver | "Highway or city? Passengers? Cargo?" -- decide BEFORE turning the key |
| sin lens | 7 driving modes (sport, eco, comfort...) | Each mode optimizes differently; same engine, different behavior |
| quality gate (F7) | Vehicle inspection station | If the car fails inspection, back to the shop -- max 2 retries |
| signal (F8) | "Delivery confirmed" notification | Car delivered; fleet manager gets the ping on their phone |
| handoff | Service order / Work order | Written instructions: "Car #42, replace brakes, check alignment, road-test" |
| dispatch | Sending the mechanic to the bay | "Bay 3, you have a brake job" -- mechanic walks over and starts work |
| wave | Production shift | Morning shift builds chassis, afternoon paints, night shift road-tests |
| grid | 6 bays working in parallel | Each bay works on a different car simultaneously; no waiting |
| RAG | Checking the parts catalog | Before the repair, look up what parts are needed and exactly where to find them |

## Extended Mapping: Top 20 Kinds

| Kind | Car Metaphor | Teaching Story Seed |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| `knowledge_card` | Page in the owner's manual | "Before any repair, the manual says exactly what the part is and why it exists" |
| `agent` | Licensed mechanic profile | "Each mechanic has a license: what they can fix, what tools they use, what they refuse" |
| `prompt_template` | Diagnostic checklist | "Same checklist, different car model -- fill in the blanks, get consistent results" |
| `system_prompt` | Mechanic's operating manual | "The manual defining identity, rules, and when to escalate to the shift supervisor" |
| `workflow` | Repair sequence diagram | "Which bay feeds which, what can run in parallel, what must wait" |
| `quality_gate` | Safety inspection sticker | "The 7-point checklist every car must pass before leaving the lot" |
| `knowledge_index` | Parts catalog (searchable) | "The catalog that tells you in 2 seconds if the part is in stock and in which bin" |
| `embedding_config` | Bar-code labeling system | "How parts are tagged so the robot arm can find them in the dark warehouse" |
| `guardrail` | Physical speed limiter | "The car physically cannot exceed the set speed -- no override, no exception" |
| `env_config` | Workshop environment settings | "Bay temperature, lift pressure, voltage: ambient conditions the repair requires" |
| `api_client` | Parts supplier connector | "The EDI link to the external supplier's loading dock -- standard plug, standard protocol" |
| `learning_record` | Post-repair service log | "What the mechanic noted after this job that will speed up the next one" |
| `entity_memory` | Vehicle service history card | "Every repair, every part replaced, every mileage check -- all departments share it" |
| `crew_template` | Multi-bay restoration plan | "When paint, bodywork, and engine must all contribute to the same classic car rebuild" |
| `decision_record` | Engineering change bulletin | "Formal record of why we stopped using that brake compound on this date" |
| `benchmark` | Dynamometer test protocol | "The standardized dyno test every engine must pass before it leaves the bench" |
| `context_doc` | Model-specific briefing sheet | "The one-pager every mechanic reads before working on a new model for the first time" |
| `chain` | Automated assembly conveyor | "Parts move to the next station based on what was installed, not a fixed timer" |
| `router` | Service desk dispatcher | "Decides which bay gets which incoming car based on job type and bay capacity" |
| `scoring_rubric` | Road-test scoring sheet | "The exact criteria: brakes, steering, noise, alignment -- scored 0-10 before handoff" |

## 8F as the Ignition-to-Destination Sequence

| Step | 8F | What the driver/mechanic does |
|------|----|-------------------------------|
| 1. Read the trip plan | F1 CONSTRAIN | Check destination, fuel, load limits -- no surprises mid-route |
| 2. Load the vehicle profile | F2 BECOME | Know this specific car: its quirks, its capacity, its maintenance history |
| 3. Stock up before departure | F3 INJECT | Fill the tank, load the cargo, get the maps -- everything needed before moving |
| 4. Plan the route | F4 REASON | Highway or city? Toll or scenic? Decide now, not at the junction |
| 5. Pre-drive check | F5 CALL | Mirrors, tyres, lights, seatbelts -- confirm tools are ready |
| 6. Drive | F6 PRODUCE | Wheels turn. The journey happens. The work gets done. |
| 7. Pass inspection | F7 GOVERN | At the checkpoint: brakes, emissions, lights. Below threshold = return to garage. |
| 8. Deliver and log | F8 COLLABORATE | Park at destination, hand over keys, file the delivery report. |

## 12 Pillars as Instrument Panel Gauges

| Gauge | Pillar | What it monitors |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Fuel level | P01 | Knowledge reserves -- run dry and the car stops |
| Speedometer | P02 | Agent capability -- how fast each agent can run |
| Navigation | P03 | Prompt routing -- are you heading to the right destination? |
| Tool compartment | P04 | Onboard tools: jack, jumper cables, GPS dongle |
| Trunk / cargo | P05 | Output capacity: what the car delivers at the destination |
| Seatbelt light | P06 | Schema compliance -- buckle up or the system warns you |
| OBD diagnostics | P07 | Real-time evaluation: engine codes, performance metrics |
| Chassis blueprint | P08 | Architecture decisions: frame type, suspension design |
| Climate control | P09 | Config settings: A/C, pressure, ambient conditions |
| Black box / EDR | P10 | Memory: every trip, every incident, every sensor reading |
| Feedback display | P11 | Learning signals: "next service in 1200 km" |
| Trip computer | P12 | Orchestration: route planning, ETA, multi-stop sequencing |

## 3 Roles: Driver, Mechanic, Engineer

| Role | Who | What they see | What they do NOT need to know |
|------|-----|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Driver (N07 + User) | Decides destination, approves route | Dashboard gauges, GPS, fuel level | How the engine converts fuel to motion |
| Mechanic (N01-N06) | Does the repair/build work | Part numbers, torque specs, service manuals | Why the customer needs the car |
| Engineer (N00 / archetypes) | Designs the car and parts | Full blueprints, material specs, failure modes | Where the driver is going today |

## Teaching Hooks (PT-BR)

**Hook 1 -- O Carro Ja Esta La:**
"Imagine que voce comprou um carro com 8 mecanicos especializados dentro do porta-mala. Cada um sabe fazer exatamente uma coisa: um so troca freio, um so pinta, um so faz alinhamento. Voce nao precisa saber como eles trabalham -- so precisar dizer para onde quer ir. O CEX e esse carro."

**Hook 2 -- O Inspetor de Veiculo:**
"Sabe a revisao obrigatoria do carro? O F7 e isso. Antes de entregar qualquer peca, tem um inspetor que checa 7 itens. Se reprovar, volta para o mecanico. Maximo 2 tentativas -- se errar duas vezes, o sistema para e avisa voce."

**Hook 3 -- O Manual do Proprietario:**
"O knowledge_card e o manual do carro. Antes de qualquer reparo, o mecanico le o manual daquela peca. Sao fatos atomicos: 'freio modelo X: torque 45 Nm, vida util 30.000 km'. Sem manual, o mecanico improvisa -- e improvisar custa caro."

**Hook 4 -- GPS vs Motorista:**
"O GDP e o GPS perguntando antes de sair: 'Prefere rota mais rapida ou mais economica? Tem pedagio?' Voce decide ANTES de ligar o carro. Depois que o motor pegou, o GPS nao pergunta mais -- ele executa o que voce escolheu."

**Hook 5 -- A Frota e o Despachante:**
"O N07 e o despachante da frota. Ele nunca dirige. Ele liga para o motorista certo, manda para o endereco certo, confirma a entrega. Se ele comecar a dirigir, quem cuida da frota inteira? O papel do orquestrador e exatamente esse: coordenar sem executar."
