# KC: The CEX Knowledge Lifecycle

## Quick Reference
```yaml
topic: The CEX Knowledge Lifecycle
scope: The architectural framework for transforming raw information into a high-fidelity, queryable knowledge graph for AI agents.
owner: N04 Knowledge Nucleus
criticality: Foundational
```

## 1. The Core Architecture: RAG-I-T
The CEX knowledge system is built on the **RAG-I-T** framework: a triad of **R**etrieval-**A**ugmented **G**eneration, **I**ngestion, and **T**axonomy. This is not just a pipeline, but a closed-loop system where each component continuously reinforces the others.

**Flow:**
`[Data Source] -> [INGESTION] -> [TAXONOMY] -> [RETRIEVAL] -> [AUGMENTATION] -> [SYNTHESIS] -> [Feedback Loop]`

| Component | Function | N04 Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ingestion** | Transforms raw data into semantically indexed vectors. | Defining chunking strategies, selecting embedding models. |
| **Taxonomy** | Structures knowledge for filtering and discovery. | Building and maintaining the CEX Knowledge Graph. |
| **Retrieval** | Finds and ranks the most relevant context for a query. | Designing retrieval logic, blending semantic & keyword search. |
| **RAG** | Augments prompts and synthesizes grounded answers. | Providing the high-quality context for other agents to use. |

## 2. Stage 1: Ingestion & Semantic Indexing
This is the foundation. Garbage in, garbage out.

### A. Content-Aware Chunking
The process of breaking down large documents into optimally-sized, semantically coherent fragments. This is the single most important factor for retrieval quality.
- **Strategy**: Varies by content type. Code is chunked by function/class, markdown by section, prose by paragraph.
- **Enrichment**: Each chunk is enriched with metadata from the source document (e.g., title, author, original path, taxonomy tags).

### B. Vectorization
A high-dimensional vector embedding is generated for each chunk using a centrally managed embedding model. This vector represents the chunk's "meaning."
- **Principle**: Chunks with similar meanings have vectors that are close in the vector space (measured by cosine similarity).
- **Storage**: Vectors and their corresponding content/metadata are stored in a dedicated vector database.

## 3. Stage 2: Structuring & Retrieval
Finding the needle in the haystack, instantly.

### A. The CEX Knowledge Graph & Taxonomy
While vector search finds *relevance*, the Knowledge Graph provides *structure* and *relationships*.
- **Nodes**: Canonical Knowledge Cards (KCs), representing validated concepts.
- **Edges**: The explicit relationships between them (e.g., `is_a`, `depends_on`, `authored_by`).
- **Taxonomy**: A strict, hierarchical classification system used to tag all nodes. It acts as the "address system" for all knowledge.

### B. Hybrid Retrieval Strategy
The most robust approach combines multiple techniques:
1.  **Pre-Filtering**: The query is first used to narrow the search space using the **Taxonomy**. (e.g., filter for all knowledge in the `N03_engineering` branch).
2.  **Semantic Search**: A vector-based (ANN) search is performed on the filtered set to find the top-k most semantically relevant chunks.
3.  **Keyword Search (Optional)**: A traditional keyword search (e.g., BM25) is run in parallel to catch specific, exact matches that semantic search might miss.
4.  **Re-Ranking**: A final model re-ranks the combined results for maximal relevance to the original query before they are passed to the LLM.

## 4. Architectural Mandates
1.  **CHUNK FOR COHESION**: Optimize chunking to ensure each chunk is a self-contained, logical unit of meaning.
2.  **EMBED FOR MEANING**: The embedding model is the heart of the system. It must be chosen and managed as a critical piece of infrastructure.
3.  **STRUCTURE FOR DISCOVERY**: Build the taxonomy and knowledge graph relentlessly. An unstructured vector store is a liability.
4.  **ITERATE ON RETRIEVAL**: The quality of the entire RAG system is a direct function of retrieval performance. This must be continuously evaluated, measured, and improved. The loop must close.

## 5. Anti-Patterns: What NOT to Do

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Uniform chunking** | Fixed-size chunks break semantic boundaries | Content-aware chunking by logical units |
| **Embedding model drift** | Changing models breaks vector consistency | Version lock embeddings, migrate systematically |
| **Pure keyword search** | Misses semantic similarity, brittle to wording | Hybrid semantic + keyword retrieval |
| **No taxonomy structure** | Vector search without filtering = noise | Build hierarchical taxonomy first |
| **One-shot ingestion** | Knowledge becomes stale, no feedback loop | Continuous ingestion with quality monitoring |
