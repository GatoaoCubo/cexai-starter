# Overview
N04 needs an embedder that rewards breadth without collapsing precision.
Knowledge Gluttony means indexing more domains, more entity variants, and more relation hints, but every extra chunk only helps if its vector remains comparable across the whole corpus.
`text-embedding-3-large` is the default hungry profile because it preserves nuance for multilingual technical markdown, taxonomy labels, memory summaries, and graph node descriptions.
The provider profile favors recall first, then reranking and graph traversal for discipline.

## Boundary
`embedder_provider` IS the contract for text-to-vector conversion.
`embedder_provider` IS NOT the vector backend, retriever policy, or graph schema.
N04 uses this artifact to keep chunk embeddings, entity embeddings, and memory embeddings aligned under one semantic geometry.

## Configuration Matrix
| Parameter | Value | Why it serves Knowledge Gluttony |
|-----------|-------|----------------------------------|
| Provider | `openai` | stable API and broad ecosystem coverage |
| Model | `text-embedding-3-large` | richer semantic capacity than smaller dense options |
| Native dimensions | `3072` | preserves detail for long-tail domain distinctions |
| Reduced dimensions | `1024` | supports lower-cost side indexes without model drift |
| Max tokens | `8191` | lets N04 keep semantically complete chunks |
| Batch size | `96` texts/request | balances throughput and provider headroom |
| Normalize | `true` | keeps cosine space stable across mixed corpora |
| Truncate | `end` | preserves leading taxonomy and title context |
| Distance metric | `cosine` | aligns with normalized vectors and mixed-length chunks |
| Sparse support | `false` | dense provider; lexical recall handled elsewhere |
| API key env | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | explicit auth boundary |
| Base URL | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | standard endpoint for shared tooling |

## Why This Model
N04 indexes repository markdown, schema notes, memory summaries, runtime configs, and graph node descriptions.
These materials are dense, domain-heavy, and often short enough that subtle phrasing matters.
A hungry knowledge nucleus benefits more from semantic resolution than from absolute token thrift.
The large profile is therefore the primary index embedder, while dimension reduction remains available for secondary caches.

## Dimension Tradeoffs
| Dimensions | Recall posture | Storage posture | Latency posture | Recommended use |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `3072` | maximum semantic appetite | highest footprint | baseline | canonical knowledge and memory index |
| `2048` | high recall with modest loss | lower than native | slightly faster | graph node sidecar embeddings |
| `1024` | balanced | medium | faster | experimentation, local mirrors, previews |
| `512` | selective | compact | fastest | coarse routing only, not canonical search |

## Corpus Fit
| Corpus slice | Embedding goal | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| knowledge artifacts | preserve domain distinctions | prioritize taxonomic and architectural nuance |
| memory artifacts | recall decisions and lessons | temporal context matters more than phrasing exactness |
| graph nodes | support hybrid graph plus vector retrieval | entity descriptions should live in same vector family |
| schema docs | cluster related constraints | helps route tasks to the right builder quickly |
| configs | identify operational adjacency | useful for cross-artifact retrieval, not exact matching |

## Integration Pattern
```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

def embed_texts(texts, dimensions=3072):
    response = client.embeddings.create(
        model="text-embedding-3-large",
        input=texts,
        dimensions=dimensions,
    )
    return [item.embedding for item in response.data]
```

## Retrieval Heuristics
1. Embed titles plus body for short artifacts where naming carries routing signal.
2. Keep chunk headers attached because N04 artifacts compress heavy meaning into section names.
3. Use `3072` for canonical storage whenever a corpus may feed memory or graph enrichment later.
4. Use `1024` only for derivative indexes, never by mixing inside the primary namespace.
5. Re-embed the entire namespace on model family change, not incrementally.

## Anti-Patterns
1. Mixing `text-embedding-3-large` and unrelated legacy vectors in one collection causes false neighborhoods.
2. Downshifting dimensions per document instead of per index breaks similarity consistency.
3. Embedding raw boilerplate headings without body context inflates low-value hubs.
4. Treating embeddings as a substitute for taxonomy weakens controllability.
5. Using one giant chunk to capture "everything known" creates vague vectors and shallow recall.

## Operational Notes
| Concern | N04 stance |
|---------|------------|
| cost pressure | reduce dimensions in derivative indexes before changing model family |
| freshness | re-embed after chunking strategy changes or metadata packing changes |
| multilingual content | keep language markers in chunk metadata, not in vector families |
| graph alignment | reuse same model for entity descriptions and source chunks |
| memory alignment | runtime and learning artifacts should stay in same vector geometry |

### How to use

```text
You are the consuming agent that acts on this embedder_provider under F3 INJECT.
- Resolve the open slots (provider, model_id) from the caller request.
- Honor every constraint and field contract declared above.
- Emit the result in the shape this embedder_provider defines; never improvise the schema.
```

### Procedure

```text
1. Load this artifact and read its contract under F3 INJECT.
2. Bind provider and model_id from the incoming request.
3. Validate the inputs against the constraints declared above.
4. Execute the embedder_provider behavior; resolve each open slot at act-time.
5. Verify the output shape, then signal completion to the orchestrator.
