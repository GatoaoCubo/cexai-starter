# Glossary Entry

## Spec
```yaml
kind: glossary_entry
pillar: P01
llm_function: INJECT
max_bytes: 512
naming: p01_gl_{{term}}.md + .yaml
core: false
```

## What It Is
A glossary_entry provides a concise definition of a domain-specific term, injected into prompts to ensure consistent vocabulary usage. It is the lightest knowledge unit in P01 — no density minimum, no complex structure, just term + definition + synonyms. It is NOT a knowledge_card (which requires density > 0.8 and formal sections) nor a context_doc (which provides broader domain scope rather than single-term definitions). Max 3 lines of definition.

## Cross-Framework Map
| Framework/Provider | Class/Concept | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| LangChain | No dedicated class; injected via system prompt | Often part of a larger context template |
| LlamaIndex | Metadata dictionary on nodes | Terms as metadata for filtered retrieval |
| CrewAI | Agent backstory vocabulary | Embedded in natural language agent descriptions |
| DSPy | `dspy.InputField(desc=...)` | Term definitions in field descriptions |
| Haystack | `PromptBuilder` variables | Injected as template context |
| OpenAI | System prompt glossary section | Common pattern: "Glossary: term = definition" |
| Anthropic | System prompt definitions | Same pattern; works well with structured blocks |

## Key Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Tradeoff |
|-----------|------|---------|----------|
| term | string | required | Must be the canonical form used in outputs |
| definition | string | required | Shorter = less tokens; longer = more precise |
| synonyms | list | [] | Helps LLM recognize variants but adds tokens |

## Patterns
| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Inline glossary | 5-15 terms for a specific domain | "KC = Knowledge Card; FSE = Few-Shot Example" |
| Dynamic glossary | Large term set, query-dependent | Retrieve relevant terms based on user query embedding |
| Disambiguation | Terms with multiple meanings | "Pool: in organization = curated knowledge repository (not thread pool)" |

## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Definition > 3 lines | Becomes a context_doc; wastes glossary budget | Split: short def in glossary, detail in context_doc |
| Glossary with 50+ terms | Token-heavy; most terms unused per query | Use dynamic selection or split by subdomain |
| Synonyms without canonical form | LLM uses random variant in output | Mark one term as canonical; others as synonyms |

## Integration Graph
```
[rag_source] --> [glossary_entry] --> [template (P03), context_doc]
                       |
                [knowledge_card]
```

## Decision Tree
- IF single term needs consistent usage THEN glossary_entry
- IF term needs multi-paragraph explanation THEN context_doc
- IF content has density > 0.8 with structured sections THEN knowledge_card
- IF term is obvious to LLM (e.g., "API") THEN skip — don't over-define
- DEFAULT: glossary_entry for any domain-specific jargon the LLM might misinterpret

## Quality Criteria
- GOOD: Term + clear 1-3 line definition + relevant synonyms
- GREAT: Disambiguates from similar terms; canonical form marked; tested that LLM uses term correctly
- FAIL: Definition exceeds 3 lines; term is universally known; duplicates a knowledge_card's scope
