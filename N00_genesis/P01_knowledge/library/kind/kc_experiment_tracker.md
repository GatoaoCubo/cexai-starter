# Experiment Tracker

## Purpose
A structured framework for documenting, executing, and analyzing experiments with configurable parameters and result tracking.

## Key Features
- **Configuration Management**: Store hypotheses, variables, and control parameters
- **Result Logging**: Automated tracking of metrics and observations
- **Version Control**: Link experiments to code versions and dependencies
- **Analysis Tools**: Built-in statistical evaluation and visualization

## Usage Example
```yaml
experiment:
  id: "exp-2023-04-15-01"
  title: "Model Optimization Test"
  parameters:
    learning_rate: 0.001
    batch_size: 32
  results:
    accuracy: 0.92
    loss: 0.078
  metadata:
    created_at: 2023-04-15T14:30:00Z
    researcher: "john.doe"
```

## Best Practices
1. Use semantic versioning for experiment IDs
2. Document all assumptions and constraints
3. Include baseline comparisons
4. Store raw data alongside aggregated results
5. Tag experiments with relevant metadata categories
