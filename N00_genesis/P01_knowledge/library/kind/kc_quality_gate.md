# Quality Gate

## Spec
```yaml
kind: quality_gate
pillar: P11
llm_function: GOVERN
max_bytes: 4096
naming: p11_qg_{{gate}}.yaml
core: true
```

## What It Is
A quality gate is a declarative threshold specification that produces a binary pass/fail verdict with numeric score. It blocks artifact promotion, pipeline progression, or deployment unless the score meets the minimum. It is NOT validator (P06 — technical pass/fail on schema/format without score) nor scoring_rubric (P07 — defines evaluation criteria; quality_gate applies criteria and enforces the threshold).

## Cross-Framework Map
| Framework/Provider | Class/Concept | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| LangChain | `RunnableLambda` score check + conditional branch | Post-LLM score evaluation gating next chain step |
| LlamaIndex | `ResponseEvaluator` + threshold filter | Faithfulness/relevancy evaluators return score; gate on threshold |
| CrewAI | `Task(guardrail=score_check)` | Guardrail returning (False, "score below threshold") blocks task completion |
| DSPy | `dspy.Assert(metric(pred) >= threshold)` | Assert with metric function as condition; blocks forward() on fail |
| Haystack | `ConditionalRouter` with score branch | Route to retry/reject if score component output < threshold |
| OpenAI | Evals API pass/fail criteria | `pass_threshold` in eval config; graders return pass/fail |
| Anthropic | Custom score check in tool use loop | Tool result score checked before next tool invocation |

## Key Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Tradeoff |
|-----------|------|---------|----------|
| min_score | float | 7.0 | Higher = better quality pool; more rejections and retries |
| on_fail | enum | block | block/retry/escalate — block = hardest gate; retry = tolerant |
| scorer | string | required | LLM judge / rubric / heuristic — defines how score is calculated |
| max_retries | int | 2 | More retries = higher final quality; more latency/cost |

## Patterns
| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Tiered gates | Different thresholds for different pools | experimental: 7.0, pool: 8.0, golden: 9.5 |
| Retry-with-feedback | Improvable failures (not structural) | on_fail: retry; pass error message to LLM for self-correction |
| Async gate | High-latency scorer (LLM judge) | Gate runs asynchronously; artifact held in pending state |

## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Gate without scorer definition | Gate passes everything; meaningless threshold | Always define scorer; must be reproducible |
| min_score: 10.0 | Nothing passes; pipeline stalls | Use 9.5 as maximum for golden tier |
| Blocking gate with no retry | Single failure permanently blocks artifact | Define max_retries >= 1; or on_fail: escalate for human review |

## Integration Graph
```
[scoring_rubric] --> [quality_gate] --> [pool / lifecycle_rule]
[reward_signal] -----^          |
                           [bugloop / retry]
```

## Decision Tree
- IF score >= 9.5 THEN pass as golden
- IF score 8.0–9.4 THEN pass as pool artifact
- IF score 7.0–7.9 THEN pass as experimental; flag for improvement
- IF score < 7.0 AND retries remaining THEN retry with scorer feedback
- IF score < 7.0 AND max_retries exhausted THEN block + escalate
- DEFAULT: min_score 7.0 for output gates; 8.0 for pool promotion gates

## Quality Criteria
- GOOD: Has gate name, min_score, scorer, on_fail, max_retries; YAML parseable
- GREAT: Tiered thresholds; scorer is reproducible; feedback passed to retry; async support for slow scorers
- FAIL: No scorer defined; min_score = 10.0 or 0.0; no retry or escalation path; gate never triggered

### How to use
```text
Role: you are the GOVERN agent at 8F step F7. Load this card BEFORE you author
or apply a quality_gate so the threshold you set is reproducible, not arbitrary.
- Read the Spec block to confirm kind=quality_gate, pillar P11, max_bytes 4096.
- Pick MIN_SCORE from the Decision Tree tiers; never set it to 10.0 or 0.0.
- Bind a concrete SCORER (llm_judge / scoring_rubric / heuristic); a gate with
  no scorer passes everything and is meaningless.
- Set ON_FAIL and, when retrying, MAX_RETRIES so a single miss cannot deadlock.
- Apply the gate, then route the verdict to a pool or lifecycle_rule.
```

### Procedure
```text
1. Resolve the scorer: choose llm_judge, scoring_rubric, or a heuristic.
2. Set MIN_SCORE from the tier you are gating (output 7.0, pool 8.0, golden 9.5).
3. Choose ON_FAIL (block | retry | escalate) and MAX_RETRIES when retrying.
4. Run the scorer over the candidate artifact to obtain a numeric score.
5. Compare score to MIN_SCORE; on pass, promote to the next pool.
6. On fail with retries left, return scorer feedback and re-run F6 PRODUCE.
7. On fail with retries exhausted, block and escalate for human review.
```

### Slots
```text
GATE_NAME = <GATE_NAME>      # identifier for this gate instance
MIN_SCORE = <MIN_SCORE>      # 7.0..9.5 promotion threshold
SCORER    = <SCORER>         # llm_judge | scoring_rubric | heuristic
ON_FAIL   = <ON_FAIL>        # block | retry | escalate
MAX_RETRIES = <MAX_RETRIES>  # int >= 1 when ON_FAIL is retry
