# C2PA Manifest Specification

## Overview
The C2PA (Certified Claims and Provenance for Authenticity) manifest is a JSON-based metadata format that provides cryptographic proof of a digital asset's authenticity, ownership, and usage rights. It enables verification of content integrity and provenance across the digital supply chain.

## Key Features
- **Immutable Provenance**: Cryptographic signatures ensure data integrity
- **Claim Validation**: Verifiable claims about content ownership and usage
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works with major digital asset platforms
- **Extensible Schema**: Supports additional metadata through custom claims

## Manifest Structure
The manifest contains three core components:

### 1. Header
```json
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/c2pa/context.jsonld",
  "type": "Manifest",
  "id": "urn:uuid:123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### 2. Claims
```json
{
  "claim": {
    "type": "Ownership",
    "issuer": "https://example.com/issuer",
    "subject": "urn:uuid:78901234-5678-90ab-cdef-112233445566",
    "validFrom": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "validUntil": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "signature": "base64-encoded-signature"
  }
}
```

### 3. Provenance
```json
{
  "provenance": {
    "type": "Creation",
    "creator": "https://example.com/creator",
    "timestamp": "2023-11-15T14:30:00Z",
    "software": "C2PA Validator 2.1.0",
    "signature": "base64-encoded-signature"
  }
}
```

## Core Components

### 1. Header
| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `@context` | URI to the context document | ✅ Yes |
| `type` | Must be "Manifest" | ✅ Yes |
| `id` | Unique identifier for the manifest | ✅ Yes |
| `version` | Schema version | ✅ Yes |

### 2. Claims
| Claim Type | Description | Use Case |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Ownership | Proves content ownership | Digital rights management |
| Usage | Grants specific usage permissions | Content licensing |
| Authenticity | Verifies content integrity | Fraud prevention |
| Attribution | Credits original creators | Content discovery |

### 3. Provenance
| Provenance Type | Description | Example |
|------------------|-------------|---------|
| Creation | Records content creation | New digital asset |
| Modification | Tracks content changes | Version history |
| Distribution | Records content sharing | Content syndication |
| Destruction | Proves content removal | Data erasure |

## Validation Process
1. **Signature Verification**: Check cryptographic signatures against public keys
2. **Schema Validation**: Ensure compliance with C2PA schema version
3. **Claim Validation**: Verify claim types and validity periods
4. **Provenance Chain**: Confirm continuity of provenance records

## Use Cases

### 1. Digital Rights Management
```json
{
  "claim": {
    "type": "Usage",
    "issuer": "https://rights.example.com",
    "subject": "urn:uuid:123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "validFrom": "2023-10-01T00:00:00Z",
    "validUntil": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "permissions": ["view", "share"]
  }
}
```

### 2. Content Verification
```json
{
  "provenance": {
    "type": "Creation",
    "creator": "https://validator.example.com",
    "timestamp": "2023-11-15T14:30:00Z",
    "software": "C2PA Validator 2.1.0",
    "signature": "base64-encoded-signature"
  }
}
```

### 3. Compliance Reporting
```json
{
  "claim": {
    "type": "Compliance",
    "issuer": "https://compliance.example.com",
    "subject": "urn:uuid:78901234-5678-90ab-cdef-112233445566",
    "validFrom": "2023-09-01T00:00:00Z",
    "validUntil": "2024-09-01T00:00:00Z",
    "standards": ["ISO 23058", "IEEE 1609.2"]
  }
}
```

## Best Practices
1. **Use UUIDs**: Always use UUIDs for identifiers
2. **Version Control**: Always specify the schema version
3. **Secure Signatures**: Use strong cryptographic algorithms
4. **Timestamping**: Include accurate timestamps for provenance
5. **Minimal Claims**: Only include necessary claims to reduce attack surface

## Common Pitfalls
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Missing signature | Always include cryptographic signatures |
| Invalid timestamp | Use trusted time-stamping services |
| Outdated schema | Always use the latest schema version |
| Missing context | Always include the @context field |
| Invalid claim types | Only use approved claim types |

## Implementation Guide
1. **Generate UUID**: Create a unique identifier for the manifest
2. **Create Claims**: Define ownership, usage, and authenticity claims
3. **Add Provenance**: Record creation and modification history
4. **Sign Manifest**: Use cryptographic signatures for integrity
5. **Validate**: Verify against C2PA schema and public keys
