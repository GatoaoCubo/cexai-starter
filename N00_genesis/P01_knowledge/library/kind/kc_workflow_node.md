A workflow node is a typed entity representing a discrete operation in a visual/programmatic workflow. It encapsulates:

1. **Type** - Functional category (e.g., "data_transform", "control_flow")
2. **Inputs/Outputs** - Defined interfaces for data exchange
3. **Metadata** - Version, author, dependencies
4. **Execution context** - Environment variables, permissions
5. **Error handling** - Retry policies, fallback mechanisms

Key characteristics:
- Composable with other nodes
- Stateful or stateless execution
- Supports parallel/sequential execution
- Version-controlled artifacts

Example use cases:
- Data pipeline stages
- UI interaction flows
- Automated testing sequences
- Configuration validation workflows

Nodes are orchestrated via connection patterns (e.g., directed acyclic graphs) to create complex operational systems while maintaining individual node encapsulation.
