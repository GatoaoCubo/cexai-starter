# Content Monetization

## Spec
```yaml
kind: content_monetization
pillar: P11
llm_function: PRODUCE
max_bytes: 5120
naming: p04_cm_{{name}}.md
core: false
```

## What It Is
A content_monetization artifact is a declarative pipeline specification that orchestrates 9 stages of content monetization: PARSE (extract content structure), PRICING (strategy selection), CREDITS (credit/token system), CHECKOUT (payment flow), COURSES (course packaging), ADS (ad placement), EMAILS (drip sequences), VALIDATE (end-to-end check), DEPLOY (go-live). It is NOT a pricing_strategy (which defines pricing logic only) nor a payment_integration (which handles a single payment provider). The content_monetization kind answers "how does this content generate revenue end-to-end?" — pricing answers "at what price?" and payment answers "through which gateway?".

## Cross-Framework Map
| Framework/Provider | Class/Concept | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Stripe | Products + Prices + Checkout Sessions | Handles PRICING+CHECKOUT stages |
| Hotmart | Product + Offer + Checkout | Brazilian course marketplace; COURSES+CHECKOUT |
| Gumroad | Product + Workflow + Email | Simple CHECKOUT+EMAILS pipeline |
| Teachable | Course + Pricing + Drip | COURSES+PRICING+EMAILS stages |
| LemonSqueezy | Product + Checkout + License | CHECKOUT+CREDITS (license keys) |
| ConvertKit | Sequences + Commerce | EMAILS+CHECKOUT integration |

## Key Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| stages | list[str] | all 9 | Fewer stages = simpler but incomplete funnel |
| pricing_model | str | one_time | one_time / subscription / credits / hybrid |
| checkout_provider | str | required | Stripe vs Hotmart vs custom; lock-in vs flexibility |
| email_provider | str | null | ConvertKit / Mailchimp / Resend; cost vs deliverability |
| credit_unit | str | null | token / credit / seat; granularity vs complexity |

## Patterns
| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Course-first pipeline | Knowledge product launch | Hotmart course with drip email + upsell |
| Credit-based access | API or tool monetization | 100 credits/month; overage at $0.02/credit |
| Hybrid checkout | Multiple revenue streams | One-time course + monthly community subscription |
| Ad-supported freemium | Content with free tier | Free articles with ads; premium removes ads |

## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No VALIDATE stage | Revenue leaks undetected | Add end-to-end test: create→pay→access→verify |
| Hardcoded prices | Cannot A/B test or localize | Use pricing_model with dynamic price lookup |
| Single checkout path | Abandonment with no recovery | Add EMAILS stage with cart-abandonment sequence |

## Integration Graph
```
[content_source] --> [PARSE] --> [PRICING] --> [CREDITS]
                                     |             |
                                [CHECKOUT] <-------+
                                     |
                          [COURSES] [ADS] [EMAILS]
                                     |
                              [VALIDATE] --> [DEPLOY]
```

## Decision Tree
- IF only need pricing logic THEN use pricing_strategy
- IF only need payment gateway wiring THEN use api_client (payment provider)
- IF only need email sequences THEN use notifier or schedule
- IF need full content-to-revenue pipeline THEN content_monetization
- DEFAULT: content_monetization when 3+ monetization stages are involved

## Quality Criteria
- GOOD: At least 5 stages defined; pricing_model set; checkout_provider specified
- GREAT: All 9 stages configured; A/B pricing support; credit system with overage; email drip sequences; end-to-end VALIDATE stage with test scenarios
- FAIL: Missing CHECKOUT stage; no pricing_model; hardcoded values with no configuration surface
