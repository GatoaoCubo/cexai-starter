# Workflow Primitive

## Spec
```yaml
kind: workflow_primitive
pillar: P12
llm_function: PRODUCE
max_bytes: 4096
naming: p12_wp_{{type}}.yaml
core: false
```

## Purpose

Workflow primitives are the atomic units that compose into complex agent workflows (DAGs). Each primitive has a single responsibility: execute a step, branch on a condition, loop until done, fan-out in parallel, or route to a nucleus.

## Primitives

| Primitive | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs |
|-----------|---------|--------|---------|
| `step` | Execute one action | task, agent | result |
| `condition` | Branch on predicate | test, if_true, if_false | selected_branch |
| `loop` | Repeat until condition | body, max_iter, stop_when | final_result |
| `parallel` | Fan-out concurrent tasks | tasks[] | results[] |
| `router` | Pick nucleus by domain | intent | nucleus, model |
| `gate` | Block until quality met | artifact, threshold | pass/fail |
| `merge` | Combine parallel results | results[] | synthesized |

## Composition Rules

1. Primitives compose left-to-right: `step -> condition -> [step, step]`
2. Parallel branches must merge before continuing: `parallel -> merge -> step`
3. Gates are synchronization points: downstream waits for gate to pass
4. Loops must have explicit `max_iter` (no infinite loops in agent workflows)

## Key Patterns

1. **Research-then-build**: `step(research) -> gate(quality) -> parallel(build N03 + build N05) -> merge -> step(verify)`
2. **Retry with feedback**: `loop(step(build) -> gate(quality), stop_when=pass, max_iter=3)`
3. **Wave execution**: `parallel(wave_nuclei) -> gate(synthesis) -> parallel(next_wave)`

## CEX Integration

- `cex_sdk/workflow/` implements all 7 primitives as Python classes
- `cex_mission_runner.py` uses wave-based parallel + gate pattern
- `cex_coordinator.py` synthesis gates map to the `gate` primitive
- DAG definitions stored in `P12_orchestration/` as YAML
