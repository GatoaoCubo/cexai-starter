## What is revision_loop_policy?

A `revision_loop_policy` is a declarative artifact (P11, GOVERN) that specifies the maximum
number of iterative revision cycles permitted on an artifact before the pipeline escalates
to a human reviewer or a senior nucleus.

The canonical rule: up to 3 iterations permitted before escalation. Conflict resolution is
priority-based (security > quality > implementation).

## Core Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `max_iterations` | int | 3 | Maximum revision cycles before escalation |
| `iteration_on_quality_floor` | float | 8.5 | Score below which a new revision triggers |
| `priority_order` | array | [security, quality, implementation] | Gate conflict resolution order |
| `escalation_target` | enum | user | Where to route after exhausting iterations |
| `escalation_message_template` | string | required | Message emitted on escalation |
| `per_scenario_overrides` | map | {} | Kind- or scenario-specific iteration budgets |

## Behavioral Contract

```
FOR each revision attempt:
  evaluate all quality gates
  IF all gates pass OR score >= iteration_on_quality_floor:
    ACCEPT artifact, stop loop
  ELSE IF attempt_count < max_iterations:
    increment attempt_count
    regenerate artifact with gate failure context injected
  ELSE:
    emit escalation_message_template
    route to escalation_target
```

Priority resolution when gates conflict:
1. security gates -- always evaluated first; failure blocks regardless of other scores
2. quality gates -- evaluated second; determines iteration threshold
3. implementation gates -- evaluated last; can be deferred to post-escalation

## Boundary Analysis

| Kind | What it does | Distinction |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `revision_loop_policy` | Governs N iterative content-quality cycles | THIS kind |
| `quality_gate` (P11) | Single pass/fail check at one pipeline stage | One gate; revision_loop_policy orchestrates N of them |
| `retry_policy` (P09) | Transient-failure retries (network, timeout, rate-limit) | Infrastructure retries, not content quality |
| `regression_check` (P11) | Compares artifact output against a known baseline | Diff-based; not iterative improvement |
| `bugloop` (P11) | Auto-detect > fix > verify cycle for code bugs | Narrower domain (code bugs vs artifact quality) |

## Design Rationale

The `revision_loop_policy` is a first-class primitive alongside `pipeline_template`. The two
kinds are designed to work together: `pipeline_template` encodes the stage sequence and
references a `revision_loop_policy` for the iteration budget at each quality gate.

## Usage Patterns

### Embedded in pipeline_template
```yaml
revision_loop:
  policy_ref: rlp_standard
  max_iterations: 3
  escalation_target: user
```

### Standalone policy for 8F F7 GOVERN
```yaml
---
id: rlp_standard
kind: revision_loop_policy
max_iterations: 3
iteration_on_quality_floor: 8.5
priority_order: [security, quality, implementation]
escalation_target: user
escalation_message_template: "Reached 3 revisions without passing: {{failing_gates}}"
---
```

### Security-critical override
```yaml
per_scenario_overrides:
  security_critical: 5
  documentation: 2
  standard: 3
```

## Builder

## Related Kinds
- `quality_gate` (P11) -- the gate evaluated on each iteration
- `pipeline_template` (P12) -- embeds revision_loop_policy as `revision_loop` block
- `bugloop` (P11) -- auto-correction loop for code bugs
- `retry_policy` (P09) -- transient-failure retries (different domain)
