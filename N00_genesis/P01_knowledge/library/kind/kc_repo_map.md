# repo_map: Codebase Context Extraction Strategy

## Overview
repo_map is a structured approach to extract and visualize codebase context through systematic analysis of source code, dependencies, and architectural patterns. It creates a navigable map of technical artifacts, enabling better understanding and maintenance of complex systems.

## How to use

You are a repo-map-builder at **F4 REASON**. Run the extraction strategy in
order to produce a navigable map before any refactor or onboarding.

1. Parse code: file structure, module hierarchy, duplication.
2. Map dependencies: trace direct/indirect coupling between modules.
3. Analyze architecture: data-flow patterns and anti-patterns (God Objects).
4. Assess technical debt: cyclomatic complexity, legacy clusters.
5. Generate docs: API refs, component + sequence diagrams, dependency graph.

## Purpose
1. Identify key components and their relationships
2. Visualize architectural patterns and data flows
3. Discover technical debt and improvement opportunities
4. Create documentation for onboarding new developers
5. Support refactoring decisions through dependency analysis

## Extraction Strategy
1. **Code Parsing**  
   - Analyze file structures and naming conventions
   - Identify package/module hierarchies
   - Detect code duplication patterns

2. **Dependency Mapping**  
   - Trace direct/indirect dependencies between modules
   - Visualize API usage patterns
   - Identify coupling/decoupling opportunities

3. **Architecture Analysis**  
   - Map microservices, monoliths, or hybrid architectures
   - Identify data flow patterns (synchronous/asynchronous)
   - Detect anti-patterns like God Objects

4. **Technical Debt Assessment**  
   - Quantify code complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index)
   - Identify legacy code clusters
   - Flag potential security vulnerabilities

5. **Documentation Generation**  
   - Auto-generate API reference docs
   - Create component diagrams and sequence diagrams
   - Maintain an up-to-date dependency graph

## Use Cases
1. Onboarding new developers to a large codebase
2. Pre-refactoring analysis to identify improvement areas
3. Documentation generation for technical specifications
4. Architecture review and optimization
5. Security audit through dependency analysis
