# Citation

## Spec

pillar: P01
llm_function: INJECT
max_bytes: 2048
naming: p01_cit_{{topic}}.md
core: false
```

## What It Is
A citation is a structured reference to an external or internal knowledge source — recording author, title, URL, date accessed, reliability tier, and relevance scope. It provides verifiable provenance for claims made in knowledge cards, context docs, and agent outputs. It is NOT a knowledge_card (P01, which contains the knowledge itself), NOT a rag_source (P01, which configures a retrieval pipeline), NOT a glossary_entry (P01, which defines a term).

## Cross-Framework Map
| Framework/Provider | Class/Concept | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| OpenAI | File search annotations | Assistants API returns file_citation objects with file_id + quote |
| Anthropic | Citations (2025) | Source-grounded responses with document/web citations |
| Google | Vertex AI Grounding | Grounding metadata with support chunks + confidence |
| LangChain | `Document.metadata["source"]` | Source tracking through retrieval chain |
| LlamaIndex | `NodeWithScore.metadata` | Source node references with relevance scores |
| Perplexity | Inline citations | Numbered references linked to search results |
| RAG pattern | Source attribution | Standard pattern: cite retrieved chunks in output |

## Key Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Tradeoff |
|-----------|------|---------|----------|
| source_type | enum | web | web/paper/book/internal/api — determines verification method |
| reliability_tier | enum | tier_2 | tier_1 (primary)/tier_2 (secondary)/tier_3 (tertiary) |
| date_accessed | date | today | Captures temporal validity of source |
| url | string | — | Direct link for verification; may rot over time |
| excerpt | string | — | Relevant quote; longer = more context but more tokens |
| relevance_scope | list | [] | Which domains/kinds this citation supports |

## Patterns
| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Inline citation | Ground a specific claim in a knowledge card | `[1] Robertson et al., BM25 scoring (2009)` |
| Citation bundle | Multiple sources supporting one domain | `p01_cit_hybrid_search.md` with 5+ references |
| Tiered reliability | Distinguish primary research from blog posts | tier_1=paper, tier_2=docs, tier_3=blog |
| Temporal freshness | Track when a source was last verified | `date_accessed` + `freshness_days: 90` |

## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| URL-only citation | No context if URL rots; no reliability signal | Include title, author, excerpt, reliability_tier |
| No date_accessed | Cannot assess temporal validity | Always record access date |
| Cite without excerpt | Reader must visit source to verify claim | Include relevant 1-3 sentence excerpt |
| Single tier for all | Blog posts weighted same as peer-reviewed papers | Use 3-tier reliability system |

## Integration Graph
```
rag_source, search_tool --> [citation] --> knowledge_card, context_doc, agent output
                                 |
                           glossary_entry, learning_record
```

## Decision Tree
- IF citing peer-reviewed paper THEN tier_1, include DOI
- IF citing official documentation THEN tier_2, include version
- IF citing blog/tutorial THEN tier_3, include date_accessed
- IF citing internal CEX artifact THEN source_type=internal, include artifact id
- DEFAULT: tier_2, web source, excerpt required

## Quality Criteria
- GOOD: source_type, title, url, date_accessed, reliability_tier all present
- GREAT: excerpt included, relevance_scope mapped, freshness policy defined
- FAIL: URL-only, no date, no reliability tier, no excerpt
