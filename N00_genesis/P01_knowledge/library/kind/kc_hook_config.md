# Hook Config

## Spec
```yaml
kind: hook_config
pillar: P04
llm_function: CONSTRAIN
max_bytes: 4096
naming: p04_hook_config_{{topic}}.md + .yaml
core: false
```

## What It Is
A hook_config is a declarative manifest that registers which hooks fire at which lifecycle events during builder execution. It is the DECLARATION layer — listing event names, hook references, execution order, and conditions. It is NOT a hook (which is the IMPLEMENTATION of the actual logic) nor an env_config (which sets environment variables). The hook_config answers "which hooks are active and when do they fire?" — the hook artifact answers "what does this hook actually do?".

## Cross-Framework Map
| Framework/Provider | Class/Concept | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Git | .git/hooks/ + core.hooksPath config | Config points to hook scripts |
| Claude Code | settings.json hooks array | Event + command + pattern matching |
| GitHub Actions | workflow YAML on: triggers | Declarative event-to-action mapping |
| Kubernetes | Admission webhooks config | ValidatingWebhookConfiguration |
| Webpack | plugin.apply(compiler.hooks) | Tap into named lifecycle hooks |
| pytest | conftest.py + pytest_plugins | Hook registration via convention |

## Key Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| events | list[str] | required | pre_save, post_save, pre_commit, post_compile, on_error |
| hooks | list[ref] | required | References to hook artifact IDs |
| execution_order | str | sequential | sequential vs parallel; safety vs speed |
| fail_strategy | str | abort | abort / warn / skip; strictness vs resilience |
| conditions | list[expr] | null | Filter by kind, pillar, or file pattern |

## Patterns
| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-save validation chain | Catch errors before write | lint_frontmatter -> check_density -> validate_schema |
| Post-compile indexer | Keep search index current | After .yaml compile, update index.db |
| On-error recovery | Self-healing pipeline | On validation fail, trigger auto-fix hook |
| Kind-scoped hooks | Different rules per artifact | agent hooks != knowledge_card hooks |

## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Hooks in code, not config | Invisible; cannot audit or toggle | Extract to hook_config; reference by ID |
| No execution order | Race conditions on shared state | Set explicit sequential or priority ordering |
| fail_strategy: skip everywhere | Silent failures accumulate | Use abort for HARD gates; warn for SOFT only |

## Integration Graph
```
[lifecycle_event] --> [hook_config] --> [hook_1, hook_2, hook_3]
                          |                    |
                   [conditions]          [execution_order]
                          |                    |
                   [kind/pillar filter]  [sequential/parallel]
```

## Decision Tree
- IF need to implement hook logic THEN use hook (P04)
- IF need environment variables THEN use env_config (P09)
- IF need runtime execution rules THEN use runtime_rule (P09)
- IF need to declare which hooks fire when THEN hook_config
- DEFAULT: hook_config when registering lifecycle hooks for a builder or pipeline

## Quality Criteria
- GOOD: At least 2 events defined; hooks referenced by ID; fail_strategy set
- GREAT: Full lifecycle coverage (pre+post for save, compile, commit); kind-scoped conditions; execution_order explicit; tested with cex_hooks.py
- FAIL: No event mapping; hooks referenced by path instead of ID; no fail_strategy
