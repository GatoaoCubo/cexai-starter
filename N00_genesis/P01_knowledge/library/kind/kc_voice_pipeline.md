# Voice Pipeline Architecture

## Overview
An end-to-end voice agent architecture enables natural language interaction through speech. This pipeline integrates audio processing, speech recognition, natural language understanding, and text-to-speech synthesis.

## Core Components
1. **Audio Capture**  
   - Microphone array with beamforming for directional audio pickup
   - Noise suppression using spectral subtraction algorithms

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Audio normalization (gain, pitch, resonance)
   - Endpoint detection to isolate speech segments
   - Speaker diarization for multi-party conversations

3. **Speech-to-Text (STT)**  
   - Acoustic model with speaker adaptation
   - Language model integration for context-aware transcription
   - Support for multiple languages and dialects

4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
   - Intent recognition with slot filling
   - Dialogue state tracking for context preservation
   - Sentiment analysis for emotional tone detection

5. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**  
   - Neural vocoder for natural speech synthesis
   - Prosody control for intonation and emphasis
   - Voice cloning for personalized output

6. **Output**  
   - Audio rendering with spatial audio for 3D positioning
   - Real-time feedback mechanisms
   - Integration with external systems via API

## Integration
- Cloud-based processing with edge device fallback
- Latency optimization for real-time applications
- Security protocols for voice data transmission

## Use Cases
- Virtual assistants
- Customer service automation
- Accessibility tools for visually impaired
- Smart home control systems
