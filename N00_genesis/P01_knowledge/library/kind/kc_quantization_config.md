# Quantization Configuration

Quantization configuration defines parameters for reducing model size and improving inference efficiency through numerical precision reduction. Key aspects include:

## 1. Bitwidth Settings
- 8-bit: 128 levels (0-255)
- 4-bit: 16 levels (0-15)
- 2-bit: 4 levels (0-3)
- 1-bit: 2 levels (0-1)

## 2. Compression Ratios
- 4x: 75% size reduction
- 8x: 87.5% size reduction
- 16x: 93.75% size reduction
- 32x: 96.875% size reduction

## 3. Optimization Techniques
- Dynamic range compression
- Weight pruning thresholds (0.01-0.99)
- Activation clipping
- Quantization-aware training

## 4. Deployment Parameters
- GPU acceleration flags
- CPU execution modes
- Memory optimization levels
- Precision fallback thresholds

## 5. Tradeoffs
- 8-bit: 2-5x speed boost, 40-70% accuracy loss
- 4-bit: 5-10x speed boost, 60-85% accuracy loss
- 2-bit: 10-15x speed boost, 70-90% accuracy loss
- 1-bit: 15-20x speed boost, 80-95% accuracy loss

## 6. Framework Compatibility
- TensorFlow Lite
- PyTorch Mobile
- ONNX Runtime
- WebAssembly (WASM)

## 7. Validation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
- Latency benchmarks
- Throughput measurements
```

## How to use

You are the inference engineer choosing a quantization profile for deployment.
Acting as that role, consult this card to pick a bitwidth and verify the
precision-performance tradeoff before shipping a `quantization_config`. This
card serves the INJECT (F3) verb: load it as grounding when you must reason
about model compression on constrained hardware.

- Read the Bitwidth and Tradeoffs tables; select the lowest bitwidth that meets
  your accuracy budget.
- Apply weight-pruning thresholds (0.01-0.99) only after fixing the bitwidth.
- Always validate the quantized model against MAE and SNR before release.
- Check Framework Compatibility for your target runtime (TFLite, ONNX, WASM).
- Never deploy a 1-bit/2-bit profile without an accuracy-fallback path.
