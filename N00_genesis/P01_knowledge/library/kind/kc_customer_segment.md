# Customer Segment: ICP Targeting and Cohort Definition

## Quick Reference
```yaml
topic: customer_segment
scope: B2B and B2C product targeting, pricing design, churn prevention
owner: product_marketing
criticality: high
```

## Key Concepts
- **Firmographics**: measurable org attributes — industry (SaaS/Fintech/Healthcare), headcount (<50 / 50-500 / 500+), ARR ($0-1M / $1-10M / $10M+), geography (NA / EU / APAC)
- **Psychographics**: behavioral attributes — pain intensity (critical / moderate / low), buying process (champion-driven / committee / self-serve), tech posture (early adopter / pragmatist / conservative)
- **Segment Size**: total addressable accounts within criteria; min viable = 100 accounts for meaningful signal
- **Willingness-to-Pay (WTP)**: the monetary ceiling per segment; drives tier design; enterprise WTP 5-20x SMB
- **Segment Stability**: segment is valid only if members stay in it for >= 12 months without reclassification

## Strategy Phases
1. **Discover**: run 15-20 win/loss interviews; tag each deal with firmographic + psychographic traits
2. **Cluster**: group deals by shared trait combinations; target >= 20% of total deals per cluster to qualify
3. **Validate**: confirm cluster with outcome metrics (ACV, churn rate, time-to-value); discard clusters with no differentiated outcome
4. **Name and Define**: assign 3-criteria minimum definition; document in a segment spec artifact
5. **Activate**: load segment definitions into ICP scoring, pricing page copy, onboarding flows, and NPS survey cohorts

## Golden Rules
- SEGMENT by WTP first — one pricing tier per WTP band, never mix
- MEASURE with ACV + NRR per segment quarterly; kill segments with NRR < 90%
- LINK every segment to a user_journey artifact for end-to-end traceability
- AVOID "Enterprise" as the only differentiator — add industry or use-case vertical

## Flow
```text
[Raw Deal Data] -> [Firmographic Tag] -> [Psychographic Tag]

                                   [Cluster by Shared Traits]
                                              |
                              [Validate with ACV + Churn Signal]
                                              |
                       VALID: [Define Spec + Activate in ICP]
                       INVALID: [Merge into adjacent segment]
```

## Comparativo

| Dimension | SMB Segment | Mid-Market | Enterprise |
|-----------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Headcount | 1-50 | 51-500 | 500+ |
| ACV range | $1K-$10K | $10K-$80K | $80K+ |
| Sales motion | Self-serve / PLG | Inside sales | Field + legal |
| Churn risk | High (30-50% annual) | Medium (10-20%) | Low (5-10%) |
| Decision speed | Days | Weeks (1-3) | Months (3-9) |
| Buying trigger | Pain (individual) | Pain (team) | Strategic initiative |
