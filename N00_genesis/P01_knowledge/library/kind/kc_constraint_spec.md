# Constraint Spec

## Spec
```yaml
kind: constraint_spec
pillar: P03
llm_function: CONSTRAIN
max_bytes: 2048
naming: p03_constraint.md
core: true
```

## What It Is
A constraint spec is a declarative set of rules that govern LLM generation behavior — output format, max length, allowed vocabulary, forbidden topics, and safety boundaries. It shapes the decoder without changing the task (action_prompt) or identity (system_prompt). It is NOT a validation_schema (P06, which validates after generation) — a constraint spec operates during generation to steer the output.

## Cross-Framework Map
| Framework/Provider | Class/Concept | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| LangChain | `BaseOutputParser` constraints / `StructuredOutputParser` | Output format constraints enforced via parser instructions |
| LlamaIndex | `ResponseSynthesizer` params / output format config | Controls how responses are synthesized and formatted |
| CrewAI | `Task(expected_output=..., guardrail=...)` | Guardrail function validates output; expected_output constrains format |
| DSPy | `Signature` output field types + `Assert`/`Suggest` | Type constraints on OutputField; runtime assertions on quality |
| Haystack | `ConditionalRouter` + component output types | Type-safe component outputs enforce structural constraints |
| OpenAI | `response_format` + `strict` mode | `json_schema` with strict=true guarantees schema compliance |
| Anthropic | `tool_choice` + `strict` param on tool defs | Strict tool use ensures schema-conformant structured output |

## Key Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Tradeoff |
|-----------|------|---------|----------|
| max_bytes | int | 5120 | Lower = concise but may truncate complex responses |
| output_format | enum | "text" | Structured = parseable but less natural; free = creative but unparseable |
| forbidden_topics | list | [] | More = safer but may over-restrict legitimate content |
| temperature_override | float | null | Lower = deterministic but less creative |

## Patterns
| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Format constraint | Need parseable output | `output_format: json, schema: {name: str, price: float}` |
| Length constraint | Token budget management | `max_tokens: 500, density_min: 0.85` |
| Safety constraint | User-facing or compliance contexts | `forbidden: [medical_advice, financial_advice, pii]` |

## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Over-constraining creative tasks | Model produces stilted, formulaic output | Relax constraints for exploration; tighten only for final output |
| Constraints in system_prompt text | Hard to version, test, or compose independently | Extract constraints to standalone constraint_spec artifact |

## Integration Graph
```
[action_prompt] --> [constraint_spec] --> [output_template]
                         |
                  [prompt_template]
```

## Decision Tree
- IF output must be machine-parseable THEN use format constraint with schema
- IF task is safety-sensitive THEN add forbidden_topics constraint
- IF token budget is tight THEN add max_bytes + density_min constraints
- DEFAULT: Minimal constraints (output_format + max_bytes only)

## Quality Criteria
- GOOD: Has output format and max_bytes defined; constraints are testable
- GREAT: Each constraint has rationale; constraints compose without conflict
- FAIL: Contradictory constraints; constraints embedded in prose; untestable rules
