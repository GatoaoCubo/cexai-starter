# Search Strategy

## Overview
A search strategy defines how computational resources are allocated during inference to optimize query processing. It determines the balance between depth of exploration and efficiency of execution.

## Purpose
1. Prioritize relevant search paths
2. Allocate compute budget dynamically
3. Balance accuracy with performance
4. Handle varying query complexity

## Key Concepts
- **Resource allocation**: Distribute GPU/CPU cycles across search branches
- **Depth control**: Limit recursion depth to prevent infinite loops
- **Priority queues**: Rank search nodes by relevance scores
- **Early stopping**: Terminate unproductive branches

## Strategy Types
1. **Greedy**: Focus on highest-scoring paths first
2. **Balanced**: Distribute resources evenly across branches
3. **Adaptive**: Adjust allocation based on real-time metrics
4. **Hybrid**: Combine multiple approaches dynamically

## Implementation
- Use token budgeting for memory management
- Apply pruning rules to eliminate low-value paths
- Monitor latency/accuracy tradeoffs
- Maintain fallback strategies for edge cases

## Use Cases
- Complex pattern matching
- Multi-step reasoning tasks
- Resource-constrained environments
- High-precision requirement scenarios
