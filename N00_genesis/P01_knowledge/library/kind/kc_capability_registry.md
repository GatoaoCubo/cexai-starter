# P01 Knowledge Kind Capability Registry

### How to use this card

```text
ROLE: you are planning a crew/dispatch (8F: INJECT this at F3). This card
documents the capability_registry kind (the index a crew planner queries).
You must treat the capabilities below as the menu, not as runnable code.
1. Identify the capability needed (Organization / Discovery / Synthesis / Validation).
2. Read its Depends-On / Enables row in the Relationship Matrix.
3. Map the capability to a spawnable agent via the live capability_registry.
4. Assemble the crew so each role's Depends-On is satisfied upstream.
```

**Relationships**:  
- Depends on: Evidence Evaluation (P14), Peer Review (P15)  
- Enables: Trust Assessment (P16), Quality Assurance (P17)  

| Validation Method | Purpose                          | Implementation Considerations |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Peer Review       | Assessing credibility            | Requires domain expertise     |
| Cross-Verification | Confirming consistency           | Multi-source comparison       |
| Statistical Testing | Quantifying validity             | Hypothesis testing            |

## Advanced Capabilities

### 5. Knowledge Evolution
**Description**: Tracking how knowledge changes over time  
**Example**: Monitoring shifts in public opinion about AI ethics  
**Implementation**:  
- Requires temporal analysis of knowledge artifacts  
- Uses version control systems for knowledge history  

### 6. Knowledge Application
**Description**: Using knowledge to solve real-world problems  
**Example**: Applying climate models to predict weather patterns  
**Relationships**:  
- Depends on: Problem Analysis (P18), Solution Design (P19)  
- Enables: Innovation (P20), Implementation (P21)  

| Application Type | Focus Area               | Success Metrics              |
|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|

| Predictive       | Forecasting outcomes     | Prediction accuracy          |
| Prescriptive     | Recommending actions     | Implementation success rate  |

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Taxonomy Construction
- Start with a seed concept and expand through iterative refinement
- Use the "bottom-up" approach for detailed categorization
- Apply the "top-down" approach for high-level classification

### 2. Ontology Design
- Define core concepts and their relationships
- Use formal languages like OWL or RDF for representation
- Ensure semantic consistency across the knowledge graph

### 3. Knowledge Integration
- Use semantic mapping to align different knowledge systems
- Implement conflict resolution strategies for contradictory information
- Maintain version history for all knowledge artifacts

### 4. Quality Assurance
- Establish validation criteria for each knowledge type
- Implement automated validation checks
- Maintain a knowledge quality dashboard
