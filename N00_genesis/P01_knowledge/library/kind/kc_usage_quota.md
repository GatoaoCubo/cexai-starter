# Usage Quota and Fair-Use Enforcement

## Definition
Usage quota is a configurable limit on resource consumption by agents or users. It ensures equitable access to system capacity through enforced constraints on request frequency, data volume, and computational load.

## Configuration Parameters
- **max_requests**: Maximum number of requests allowed per time window
- **time_window**: Duration (seconds) for quota calculation (e.g., 3600 for hourly)
- **breach_actions**: Response to quota violations (log, throttle, block)
- **priority_levels**: Weighting for different user/agent types
- **reset_interval**: Period after which quota resets (e.g., daily)

## Enforcement Mechanisms
1. **Rate Limiting**: Automatic throttling when thresholds are approached
2. **Request Queuing**: Temporary holding of excess requests
3. **Usage Reporting**: Detailed analytics for quota management
4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Auto-scaling based on historical usage patterns

## Fair-Use Principles
- Prevents resource monopolization by any single entity
- Ensures service availability for all users
- Supports multi-tenancy in shared infrastructure
- Enables cost-effective resource allocation

## Enforcement Examples
- API rate limiting for public endpoints
- Concurrent connection caps for database access
- CPU/ memory usage thresholds for containerized workloads
- Data transfer limits for networked services

## Monitoring
- Real-time usage dashboards
- Historical usage analytics
- Alert thresholds for approaching limits
- Usage reporting for audit purposes

## Best Practices
- Set conservative initial quotas with room for growth
- Use tiered pricing models for different priority levels
- Monitor usage patterns for anomaly detection
- Provide clear documentation for quota limits
- Allow for temporary overrides during critical operations
