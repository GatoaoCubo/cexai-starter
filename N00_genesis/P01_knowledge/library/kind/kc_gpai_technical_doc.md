# General Purpose AI (GPAI) Technical Documentation

## 1. Introduction
General Purpose AI (GPAI) represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, aiming to create systems capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can do. Unlike narrow AI systems designed for specific tasks, GPAI combines advanced machine learning techniques, natural language processing, and cognitive architectures to achieve human-like reasoning and problem-solving capabilities.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of GPAI technical foundations, including key concepts, architectural frameworks, implementation strategies, ethical considerations, and compliance requirements.
