# API Client

## Spec
```yaml
kind: api_client
pillar: P04
llm_function: CALL
max_bytes: 1024
naming: p04_api_{{service}}.md + .yaml
core: false
```

## What It Is
An API client is a typed wrapper around an external REST, GraphQL, or gRPC endpoint that an agent can invoke. It provides a deterministic, schema-validated interface for making outbound calls. It is NOT a db_connector (which targets databases specifically) nor an mcp_server (which exposes tools inward to the LLM). An API client is unidirectional: agent calls out to an external service.

## Cross-Framework Map
| Framework/Provider | Class/Concept | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| LangChain | `BaseTool` wrapping `requests` / API SDK | Custom tool that calls external API with typed input |
| LlamaIndex | LlamaHub tool specs / custom `FunctionTool` | Tool wrappers around external API calls |
| CrewAI | `BaseTool` with API call in `_run()` | Custom tool making HTTP requests to external services |
| DSPy | Python function called inside `Module.forward()` | Direct API calls within module execution flow |
| Haystack | Custom `@component` making HTTP calls | Component wrapping external service interaction |
| OpenAI | `function` tool with developer-side execution | Model requests function call; developer executes API call |
| Anthropic | `tool` definition with developer-side execution | `tool_use` block triggers developer to call external API |

## Key Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Tradeoff |
|-----------|------|---------|----------|
| base_url | string | required | Hardcoded = simple but inflexible across environments |
| auth_method | enum | "bearer" | API key = simple; OAuth = secure but complex setup |
| timeout_ms | int | 5000 | Higher = tolerant of slow APIs but blocks agent longer |
| retry_count | int | 1 | More retries = resilient but higher latency on failures |

## Patterns
| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| SDK wrapper | Official SDK available | `BlingConnector(api_key=...)` wrapping Bling V3 REST API |
| Generic HTTP client | No SDK, simple REST endpoints | `requests.get(url, headers=auth)` with typed response |
| Rate-limited client | API has usage quotas | Client with built-in rate limiter and quota tracking |

## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Raw HTTP calls without typing | No validation, silent failures on schema changes | Wrap in typed client with response validation |
| Hardcoding auth credentials | Security risk, breaks across environments | Use env vars or secret manager for credentials |

## Integration Graph
```
[action_prompt] --> [api_client] --> [output_template]
                        |
                  [constraint_spec]
```

## Decision Tree
- IF external service has official SDK THEN wrap SDK in api_client
- IF no SDK and simple REST THEN use generic HTTP client pattern
- IF API has rate limits THEN add rate-limited client pattern
- DEFAULT: Typed wrapper with auth from env vars and 5s timeout

## Quality Criteria
- GOOD: Has base_url, auth method, typed request/response, under 1024 bytes
- GREAT: Includes retry logic, rate limiting, error mapping, and health check
- FAIL: Raw untyped HTTP calls; hardcoded credentials; no error handling
