# White-Label Configuration Guide

White-label configuration is the process of customizing a software product to match a client's brand identity while maintaining the core functionality of the platform. This guide provides detailed instructions, best practices, and examples for configuring white-label settings.

## Key Components of White-Label Configuration

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Branding | Customization of logos, color schemes, and typography |
| UI/UX | Tailoring the user interface to match client preferences |
| API Integration | Enabling seamless data exchange with third-party systems |
| Security | Implementing access controls and data encryption |
| Analytics | Customizing reporting dashboards and metrics |
| Support | Tiered customer support configurations |
| Compliance | Adherence to industry-specific regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) |

## Configuration Parameters

### 1. Branding Settings
- **Logo**: Upload a high-resolution PNG file (max 500KB)
- **Primary Color**: Hex code (e.g., `#007BFF`)
- **Secondary Color**: Hex code (e.g., `#6C757D`)
- **Typography**: Font family (e.g., "Roboto", "Arial")
- **Watermark**: Enable/disable and customize transparency
- **Favicon**: Upload a 16x16 PNG file for browser tabs
- **Brand Guidelines**: Link to client's brand style guide (optional)

### 2. UI/UX Customization
- **Theme**: Light/dark mode toggle
- **Language**: Supported languages (e.g., English, Spanish, French)
- **Navigation**: Custom menu items and layout
- **Onboarding**: Welcome screen and tutorial customization
- **Custom CSS**: Inline styles for advanced theming
- **Dark Mode**: Enable/disable and customize accent colors

### 3. API Integration
- **Endpoints**: Whitelist of allowed API endpoints
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 or API keys
- **Rate Limiting**: Set request limits per client
- **Webhooks**: Configure event-driven notifications
- **CORS Configuration**: Define allowed origins and methods
- **API Versioning**: Specify versioned endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/*`)

### 4. Security Settings
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions (admin, editor, viewer)
- **Data Encryption**: AES-256 for data at rest and in transit
- **Audit Logs**: Enable logging for all user actions
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enforce TFA for admin accounts
- **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict access to specific IP ranges
- **Session Timeout**: Set inactivity logout duration (e.g., 30 minutes)

### 5. Analytics & Reporting
- **Dashboard Customization**: Predefined widgets and metrics
- **Data Sources**: Integration with third-party analytics tools
- **Custom Metrics**: Define KPIs for client-specific reporting
- **Export Options**: CSV/JSON export for data analysis
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor feature adoption and engagement

### 6. Support Configuration
- **Tiered Support**: Define support levels (basic, premium, enterprise)
- **SLA Metrics**: Set response time and resolution targets
- **Knowledge Base**: Link to client-specific documentation
- **Support Channels**: Enable email, chat, or ticketing systems
- **Escalation Policies**: Define escalation paths for critical issues

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Branding**: Ensure all visual elements align with the client's brand guidelines.
2. **Security First**: Implement strict access controls and regular security audits.
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Design configurations to handle growth in users and data volume.
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep the platform updated with the latest security patches and features.
5. **User Feedback**: Incorporate client feedback to refine the configuration settings.
6. **Compliance Audits**: Regularly verify adherence to industry-specific regulations.

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Discovery Phase**  
   - Identify client branding requirements  
   - Assess technical constraints and capabilities  
   - Define scope of customization  

2. **Configuration Development**  
   - Create brand-specific theme files  
   - Set up API integration with client systems  
   - Configure security policies and access controls  
   - Develop custom analytics dashboards  

3. **Testing & Validation**  
   - Conduct UAT (User Acceptance Testing) with client stakeholders  
   - Validate API endpoints and authentication flows  
   - Test security configurations for vulnerabilities  
   - Verify compliance with regulatory requirements  

4. **Deployment & Monitoring**  
   - Roll out configuration in staging environment  
   - Monitor performance and user feedback  
   - Implement logging and alerting for anomalies  
   - Schedule regular compliance audits  

## Example Configurations

### Example 1: SaaS Platform Customization
```yaml
branding:
  logo: "https://example.com/logo.png"
  primary_color: "#007BFF"
  secondary_color: "#6C757D"
  typography: "Roboto"
  favicon: "https://example.com/favicon.png"
security:
  access_control:
    roles:
      admin: ["create", "edit", "delete"]
      editor: ["edit", "view"]
      viewer: ["view"]
analytics:
  dashboard:
    widgets:
      - "user_activity"
      - "system_performance"
      - "feature_usage"
support:
  tiers:
    basic: ["email_support", "standard_hours"]
    premium: ["chat_support", "24/7_hours"]
```

### Example 2: Enterprise Application Integration
```json
{
  "api_integration": {
    "endpoints": ["https://api.example.com/v1/*"],
    "authentication": "OAuth 2.0",
    "rate_limit": 1000,
    "cors": {
      "allowed_origins": ["https://example.com", "https://partner.example.com"],
      "allowed_methods": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]
    }
  },
  "analytics": {
    "dashboard": "custom",
    "metrics": ["user_activity", "system_performance", "feature_usage"]
  },
  "compliance": {
    "regulations": ["GDPR", "HIPAA"],
    "audit_logs": {
      "retention": "730 days",
      "encryption": "AES-256"
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
