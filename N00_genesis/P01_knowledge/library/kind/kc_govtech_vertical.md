# Government Tech Verticals: A Comprehensive Guide

Government technology verticals represent specialized domains within the public sector where digital transformation initiatives are focused. These verticals address specific challenges and opportunities in areas like public services, infrastructure, and citizen engagement.

## Key Components of Government Tech Verticals

1. **Digital Services**: Online platforms for citizen interaction (e.g., tax filing, license renewals)
2. **Public Safety**: Emergency response systems, crime prevention technologies
3. **Healthcare**: Telemedicine, electronic health records, public health monitoring
4. **Education**: E-learning platforms, student information systems
5. **Transportation**: Intelligent traffic management, public transit optimization
6. **Environment**: Climate monitoring, waste management systems
7. **Finance**: Public financial management, procurement systems
8. **Workforce**: HR management, employee training platforms

## Common Government Tech Verticals

### How to use this card

```text
ROLE: you are a builder scoping an AI solution for a public-sector client.
8F: INJECT this card at F3 to FRAME a govtech_vertical artifact. You must
read the vertical's row before building and never skip the Challenges screen.
Action: pick the target vertical from the Common Verticals table, read its focus
areas + key technologies, and check the solution against the four Challenges
(data privacy, legacy integration, digital divide, public trust) before building.
Pair with kc_safety_policy for the compliance layer and a threat_model for risk.
```

### Procedure (scope a govtech solution)

```text
Step 1  SELECT   -- choose one vertical from the Common Verticals table.
Step 2  GROUND   -- list its focus areas + key technologies for the client context.
Step 3  CHECK    -- screen against the 4 Challenges; flag any that apply.
Step 4  COMPLY   -- attach kc_safety_policy + a threat_model for the risk surface.
Step 5  FRAME    -- author the govtech_vertical artifact; feed its quality gate.
```
