# Browser Tool

## Spec
```yaml
kind: browser_tool
pillar: P04
llm_function: CALL
max_bytes: 2048
naming: p04_browser_{{target}}.md + .yaml
core: true
```

## What It Is
A browser tool automates web browser interactions at the DOM level — navigating URLs, clicking elements, filling forms, extracting content, and capturing screenshots. It operates via Playwright, Puppeteer, or Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP). It is NOT computer_use (which controls the full screen/keyboard/mouse generically) nor a search_tool (which queries search engines without navigating pages). A browser tool interacts with web pages structurally.

## Cross-Framework Map
| Framework/Provider | Class/Concept | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| LangChain | `PlaywrightBrowserToolkit` / community browser tools | Suite of tools for navigate, click, extract, screenshot |
| LlamaIndex | Custom `FunctionTool` wrapping Playwright | Browser actions exposed as callable tools |
| CrewAI | `BaseTool` with Playwright/Selenium in `_run()` | Agent tool automating browser interactions |
| DSPy | Python function calling Playwright in `forward()` | Direct browser automation within module execution |
| Haystack | Custom `@component` with browser automation | Browser component in scraping or testing pipelines |
| OpenAI | No native browser — `code_interpreter` can fetch URLs | Limited to HTTP fetching, not full DOM interaction |
| Anthropic | `computer_use` (screen-level) / MCP browser servers | `computer_20251124` for visual; MCP for DOM-level |

## Key Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Tradeoff |
|-----------|------|---------|----------|
| engine | enum | "playwright" | Playwright = modern, fast; Selenium = legacy but wider support |
| headless | bool | true | Headless = fast, no display; headed = debuggable, observable |
| timeout_ms | int | 30000 | Higher = tolerant of slow pages but blocks agent longer |
| stealth | bool | false | Stealth = bypasses detection but adds complexity and fragility |

## Patterns
| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Headless scraping | Data extraction at scale | Playwright headless → navigate → extract product data |
| Observable automation | Debugging or user-visible flows | Chrome headed → user watches agent navigate |
| Parallel sessions | Multi-page concurrent scraping | Named Playwright sessions scraping different marketplaces |

## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Using browser for simple HTTP fetches | Massive overhead for a task that `requests` handles | Use api_client or WebFetch for non-JS pages |
| Hardcoded CSS selectors | Break on any UI change | Use data-testid attributes or semantic selectors |

## Integration Graph
```
[action_prompt] --> [browser_tool] --> [output_template]
                        |
              [computer_use, api_client]
```

## Decision Tree
- IF page requires JavaScript rendering THEN use browser_tool
- IF page is static HTML THEN use api_client/WebFetch instead
- IF need to debug visually THEN use headed mode
- IF scraping at scale THEN use headless with parallel sessions
- DEFAULT: Playwright headless with 30s timeout

## Quality Criteria
- GOOD: Clear target URL pattern, engine specified, timeout configured
- GREAT: Self-healing selectors, retry on navigation failure, screenshot on error
- FAIL: Hardcoded selectors without fallback; no timeout; uses browser for static pages
