# Memory Scope

## Spec
```yaml
kind: memory_scope
pillar: P02
llm_function: INJECT
max_bytes: 2048
naming: p02_memscope.md
core: false
```

## What It Is
A memory_scope defines what memory an agent has access to, how it persists, and when it expires. It specifies memory types (episodic, semantic, procedural), storage backends (files, vector stores, databases), and TTL (time-to-live) policies. It is NOT session_state (P10, which tracks volatile in-session data) nor a knowledge_card (which stores static facts). Memory scope answers "what does this agent remember and for how long?" — session state answers "what is happening right now?"

## Cross-Framework Map
| Framework/Provider | Class/Concept | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| LangChain | `ConversationBufferMemory` / `VectorStoreMemory` | Multiple memory types; pluggable backends |
| LlamaIndex | `ChatMemoryBuffer` / storage context | Memory attached to chat engine or agent |
| CrewAI | `memory=True` on Crew | Short-term, long-term, entity memory auto-managed |
| DSPy | No built-in memory | State managed externally; examples cached |
| Haystack | `ChatMessageStore` | Conversation memory via store interface |
| OpenAI | Assistants thread history | Automatic conversation memory per thread |
| Anthropic | No native memory | organization implements via file-based MEMORY.md system |

## Key Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Tradeoff |
|-----------|------|---------|----------|
| memory_types | list | [episodic] | More types = richer recall but higher storage/token cost |
| backend | enum | file | Vector store = semantic search; file = simple; DB = scalable |
| ttl | duration | session | Longer TTL = more context but stale memories accumulate |
| max_entries | int | 100 | Higher = more recall but slower retrieval and token cost |

## Patterns
| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Session-only memory | Stateless tasks, no continuity needed | Chat assistant with conversation buffer, cleared on exit |
| Persistent file memory | Cross-session learning, single user | organization MEMORY.md — user prefs, feedback, project state |
| Vector-backed memory | Large memory pool, semantic search needed | FAISS index of past interactions for similar-case retrieval |
| Tiered memory | Balance cost and recall | Hot (session buffer) → warm (file) → cold (vector archive) |

## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Unlimited memory without TTL | Token cost grows unbounded; stale memories mislead | Set TTL; consolidate old memories periodically |
| Memorizing everything | Low-value memories dilute high-value ones | Filter: only save surprising, non-obvious, reusable facts |
| No memory consolidation | Duplicates accumulate; retrieval quality drops | Periodic dedup + merge of related memories |

## Integration Graph
```
[agent, boot_config] --> [memory_scope] --> [session_state (P10), knowledge_index (P10)]
                              |
                       [knowledge_card, context_doc]
```

## Decision Tree
- IF task is stateless (no cross-session needs) THEN session buffer only
- IF single user needs cross-session learning THEN file-based persistent memory
- IF large-scale memory with semantic search THEN vector-backed memory
- IF tracking volatile in-session data THEN session_state (P10), not memory_scope
- DEFAULT: file-based persistent memory with monthly consolidation

## Quality Criteria
- GOOD: Memory types specified; backend defined; TTL set; max_entries bounded
- GREAT: Consolidation strategy defined; tested memory retrieval quality; tiered storage with clear promotion rules
- FAIL: No TTL (unbounded growth); memorizes everything; no backend specified; confused with session_state
