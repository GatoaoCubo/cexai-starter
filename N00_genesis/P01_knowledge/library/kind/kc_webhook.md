# Webhook

## Spec
```yaml
kind: webhook
pillar: P04
llm_function: CALL
max_bytes: 1024
naming: p04_webhook_{{event}}.md + .json
core: false
```

## What It Is
A webhook is an HTTP endpoint that receives (inbound) or dispatches (outbound) event payloads asynchronously. It processes events from external systems (Stripe, GitHub, WhatsApp) or pushes events to them on agent-triggered conditions. Its boundary is async event exchange — receive fast, process async. It is NOT an api_client (synchronous request/response pattern) nor a notifier (which delivers user-facing messages, not typed system events).

## Cross-Framework Map
| Framework/Provider | Class/Concept | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| LangChain | n/a (no native webhook kind) | FastAPI endpoint + LC callback |
| LlamaIndex | n/a | Custom FastAPI integration |
| CrewAI | n/a | Webhook triggers crew via REST |
| DSPy | n/a | External trigger pattern |
| Haystack | n/a | REST endpoint wrapping Haystack pipeline |
| OpenAI | n/a | Webhook via external server |
| Anthropic | n/a | Webhook via external server |

## Key Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| direction | str | inbound | inbound / outbound / bidirectional |
| event_type | str | required | Typed to specific event schema |
| signature_header | str | null | Required for production inbound security |

## Patterns
| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Signature verification | All production inbound endpoints | HMAC-SHA256 on X-Signature header |
| Idempotency key | Retry-safe event processing | Store event_id; skip if already seen |

## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No signature verification | Spoofed events accepted silently | Verify HMAC or bearer token always |
| Sync heavy processing | Webhook timeout (5-10s limit) | Acknowledge immediately; process async |

## Integration Graph
```
[external_event] --> [webhook_receiver] --> [event_queue / agent_trigger]
[agent_event]    --> [webhook_dispatcher] --> [external_service]
```

## Decision Tree
- IF synchronous request-response needed THEN use api_client
- IF user-facing message delivery THEN use notifier
- IF persistent bidirectional stream THEN use dedicated streaming connection
- DEFAULT: webhook for any async HTTP event exchange with external systems

## Quality Criteria
- GOOD: direction set, event_type typed with schema, async handler
- GREAT: HMAC signature verification, idempotency key, retry queue, dead letter
- FAIL: no signature check, synchronous heavy handler, no event schema defined
