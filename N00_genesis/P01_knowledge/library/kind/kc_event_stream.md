# Knowledge Card: event_stream

## Definition
An `event_stream` is a configuration artifact for a real-time, ordered, durable sequence
of domain events consumed by one or more independent subscribers. Industry implementations:
Kafka topic, AWS Kinesis stream, Azure Event Hub, Apache Pulsar topic. Events are written
by a producer and read by consumer groups, each tracking their own offset independently.

## When to Use
- Multiple independent consumers need the same domain events
- Events must be replayable (for audit, reprocessing, or onboarding new consumers)
- Order of events within an entity's lifecycle matters (per-partition ordering)
- Throughput exceeds what synchronous HTTP can handle reliably (> ~100 events/sec)
- Temporal decoupling required: producer and consumers don't need to be alive simultaneously

## When NOT to Use
- Single outbound HTTP call to one endpoint: use `webhook`
- Internal CEX nucleus coordination signal: use `signal` (not a user-facing kind)
- One-time notification to one recipient: use `webhook`
- Time-triggered batch: use `schedule`
- Request-response pattern: use `api_client`

## Structure
Every `event_stream` configures:
1. **Event types**: which domain events flow through this stream
2. **Producer**: which service or aggregate writes to the stream
3. **Consumer groups**: each group has independent offset + lag tolerance
4. **Partitioning**: partition key (for ordering) + partition count (for parallelism)
5. **Retention**: time (hours) + bytes (GB) -- determines replay window
6. **Delivery semantics**: at_most_once, at_least_once, or exactly_once
7. **Schema**: format (Avro/Protobuf/JSON) + registry + compatibility mode
8. **Operations**: lag thresholds, alerts, producer error rate

## Consumer Groups Explained
Each consumer group reads the stream independently:
- Group A (fulfillment): reads from latest, processes in real time
- Group B (analytics): reads from earliest, processes historical data
- Group C (audit): reads everything, slow lag tolerance acceptable
All three groups read the same events without interfering with each other.

## Partition Design
Partition key determines both parallelism and ordering scope:
- `orderId` as key: all events for one order go to the same partition (ordered per order)
- `userId` as key: all events for one user go to the same partition
- No key: round-robin (no per-entity ordering guarantee)

## Delivery Semantics Trade-offs
| Semantic | Data loss risk | Duplication risk | Cost |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|------|
| at_most_once | possible | none | low |
| at_least_once | none | possible | medium |
| exactly_once | none | none | high |

Default: at_least_once. Use exactly_once only for financial or idempotency-critical flows.

## Use Cases
1. **Order events stream**: OrderPlaced, OrderPaid, OrderShipped consumed by fulfillment, analytics, and notification services independently
2. **User activity stream**: PageViewed, ItemAddedToCart consumed by personalization and fraud detection
3. **IoT sensor stream**: device telemetry consumed by real-time alerting and historical archiving

## Relationships to Other Kinds
| Kind | Relationship |
|------|-------------|
| `webhook` | single outbound HTTP push to one endpoint (no ordering, no replay, 1 consumer) |
| `process_manager` | subscribes to event streams to drive process state transitions |
| `domain_event` | schema of individual events flowing through the stream |
| `api_client` | may consume events via HTTP SSE or WebSocket (pull-based alternative) |

## Anti-Patterns
- **No partition key**: loses per-entity ordering; always specify a partition key
- **One consumer group for all**: each independent consumer needs its own group
- **Missing schema registry**: without a registry, schema evolution causes breaking changes
- **Retention too short**: if a consumer goes offline for 48h and retention is 24h, events are lost
- **Confusing with webhook**: webhook is push to one; event_stream is pull by many
