# lineage_record

## Spec
```yaml
kind: lineage_record
pillar: P01
llm_function: INJECT
max_bytes: 3072
naming: p01_lin_{{name}}.md + .yaml
core: false
```

## What It Is
A lineage_record documents the provenance chain of a knowledge artifact: what sources it was derived from, what transformation activities occurred, and which agents (nuclei, tools, humans) were responsible. Based on the W3C PROV-O standard (PROV Ontology).

It is NOT:
- `audit_log` (compliance event sequence -- records who did what for regulatory purposes; no provenance semantics)
- `citation` (in-text source reference -- a single bibliographic entry; not a full derivation chain)
- `learning_record` (session learning capture -- records what was learned, not how an artifact was made)

## When to Use
- After synthesizing a knowledge_card from multiple rag_sources
- After a large knowledge import wave (FRACTAL_FILL)
- When an artifact is derived from prior artifacts in a chain
- For reproducibility: anyone should be able to re-derive the artifact from the lineage
- For compliance or audit requirements on knowledge provenance

## When NOT to Use
- Recording compliance events -> use `audit_log`
- Adding a citation in a document -> use `citation`
- Capturing session learnings -> use `learning_record`
- Tracking entity facts -> use `entity_memory`

## Structure
```yaml
# Required frontmatter fields
id: p01_lin_{name_slug}
kind: lineage_record
pillar: P01
target_artifact: "artifact-id-whose-provenance-is-recorded"
sources_count: N
activities_count: N
derivation_type: wasDerivedFrom | wasGeneratedBy | wasQuotedFrom | wasRevisionOf
quality: null
```

```markdown
## Entities
Table: id, type, location/URL, retrieval_timestamp (ISO 8601)

## Activities
Table: id, label, used (entity ids), generated (entity id), agent, timestamp

## Agents
Table: id, type (nucleus|tool|human), role

## Derivation Relations
PROV-O triples: target wasGeneratedBy activity, target wasDerivedFrom source, etc.
```

## PROV-O Core Vocabulary
| Term | Meaning in CEX |
|------|---------------|
| prov:Entity | knowledge artifact, rag_source, raw document, dataset |
| prov:Activity | ingestion, synthesis, distillation, validation, annotation |
| prov:Agent | nucleus (N01-N07), tool, human curator |
| wasDerivedFrom(E2, E1) | knowledge_card built from rag_source |
| wasGeneratedBy(E, A) | artifact produced by synthesis activity |
| wasAttributedTo(E, Ag) | artifact attributed to N04 |
| used(A, E) | activity consumed a source entity |

## Derivation Types
| Type | When |
|------|------|
| wasDerivedFrom | Target built directly from source |
| wasGeneratedBy | Target is output of a specific activity |
| wasQuotedFrom | Target contains verbatim content |
| wasRevisionOf | Target is an update of a prior artifact |

## Relationships
```
[rag_source] --> [ingestion activity] --> [knowledge_card]
[knowledge_card] --> [lineage_record] (provenance of the KC)
[lineage_record] -- cites --> [citation] (extracted source refs)
[audit_log] -- compliance copy of --> [lineage_record] (optional)
```

## Decision Tree
- IF synthesizing KC from multiple sources -> create lineage_record immediately
- IF source is unknown -> use entity type: unknown; note "provenance unavailable"
- IF artifact is revised -> use wasRevisionOf derivation type
- IF tool generated artifact -> agent type: tool; include tool id
- DEFAULT: create lineage_record after any FRACTAL_FILL or import wave

## Concrete Provenance Chain Example

The following shows a complete lineage_record for a knowledge_card synthesized from three RAG sources by N04:

```yaml
# p01_lin_kc_react_patterns.md
---
id: p01_lin_kc_react_patterns
kind: lineage_record
pillar: P01
target_artifact: "kc_react_patterns"
sources_count: 3
activities_count: 2
derivation_type: wasDerivedFrom
quality: null
