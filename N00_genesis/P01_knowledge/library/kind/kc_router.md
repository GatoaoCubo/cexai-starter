# Router

## Spec
```yaml
kind: router
pillar: P02
llm_function: REASON
max_bytes: 1024
naming: p02_rt_{{scope}}.yaml
core: true
```

## What It Is
A router is a structured rule that maps task keywords or intent signals to the correct agent_group or agent for execution. It enables the orchestrator to reason about where to dispatch work without hardcoding decisions. It is NOT a dispatch_rule (P12, which orchestrates multi-step workflows) nor a fallback_chain (model-to-model cascading). A router is a single-hop mapping: task in, target out.

## Cross-Framework Map
| Framework/Provider | Class/Concept | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| LangChain | `RunnableParallel` / custom router chains | Conditional routing via LCEL branching |
| LlamaIndex | `RouterQueryEngine` / `ObjectIndex` | Selects sub-engine based on query classification |
| CrewAI | `Process.hierarchical` manager routing | Manager agent routes tasks to crew members |
| DSPy | `dspy.Module.forward()` branching logic | Programmatic routing inside module's forward method |
| Haystack | `ConditionalRouter` component | Routes pipeline flow based on conditions/templates |
| OpenAI | Function/tool selection via `tool_choice` | Model selects which function to call based on intent |
| Anthropic | `tool_choice` (auto/any/tool) | Controls which tool the model routes to |

## Key Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Tradeoff |
|-----------|------|---------|----------|
| keywords | list[str] | required | More keywords = higher recall but risk of false matches |
| target | string | required | Single target = deterministic vs multi = needs tiebreaker |
| priority | int | 0 | Higher = preferred when multiple routers match |

## Patterns
| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Keyword match | Simple, fast routing | `keywords: [pesquisar, mercado] -> research_agent` |
| Semantic similarity | Ambiguous or novel queries | Embed query, compare to router descriptions, pick closest |
| Cascade routing | Primary target may reject | Try research_agent, if reject try marketing_agent, fallback to builder_agent |

## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Overlapping keywords across routers | Ambiguous routing, random target selection | Deduplicate keywords; assign each keyword to exactly one router |
| Routing by model instead of capability | Wrong agent_group gets tasks it cannot handle | Route by domain/skill, not by model name |

## Integration Graph
```
[mental_model] --> [router] --> [dispatch_rule]
                      |
              [action_prompt]
```

## Decision Tree
- IF keywords match exactly one router THEN dispatch to that target
- IF keywords match multiple routers THEN use priority field as tiebreaker
- IF no keywords match THEN fall back to semantic similarity or default target
- DEFAULT: Route to the agent_group with the broadest domain scope

## Quality Criteria
- GOOD: Has keywords, target, and scope defined; no overlapping keywords
- GREAT: Includes priority, confidence threshold, and fallback target
- FAIL: Ambiguous keywords shared across routers; missing target; >1024 bytes
