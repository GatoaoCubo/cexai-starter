# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Policy for Multi-Tenant Isolation

This policy defines access control mechanisms to ensure secure isolation between tenants in a multi-tenant system. It establishes role-based permissions to prevent unauthorized access to tenant-specific resources.

## Key Principles

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**  
   Users are granted only the permissions necessary to perform their role-specific tasks.

2. **Tenant Isolation**  
   Each tenant's resources are completely isolated from other tenants, with no cross-tenant access by default.

3. **Role Separation**  
   Roles are strictly separated to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure accountability.

## Role Definitions

| Role              | Permissions                                                                 | Description                                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Tenant Admin      | Full access to tenant resources                                            | Manages tenant configuration and users        |
| Developer         | Read/write access to application code                                       | Deploys and maintains tenant-specific code    |
| Viewer            | Read-only access to tenant data                                            | Monitors tenant operations                   |
| Auditor           | Read access to audit logs and compliance reports                            | Reviews security and compliance metrics      |

## Enforcement Mechanisms

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Centralized authentication and authorization system
- **API Gateways**: Enforce access control at the API level
- **Database Row-Level Security**: Isolate tenant data at the database level
- **Audit Logging**: Track all access and modification activities

## Security Considerations

- Regularly review and update role permissions
- Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive roles
- Monitor for anomalous access patterns
- Maintain detailed audit trails for compliance

## Example Scenarios

1. **Tenant Admin Actions**:
   - Create/destroy tenant instances
   - Assign roles to users
   - Configure tenant-specific settings

2. **Developer Actions**:
   - Deploy application code to tenant environment
   - Access diagnostic logs for their tenant
   - Request temporary elevated permissions for troubleshooting

3. **Viewer Actions**:
   - Access tenant performance metrics
   - View system-wide statistics (aggregated across tenants)
   - Receive alerts about tenant-specific events

This policy ensures that tenants are completely isolated while allowing necessary interactions between tenants and system administrators.
