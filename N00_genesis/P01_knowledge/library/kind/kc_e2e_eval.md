# E2E Eval

## Spec
```yaml
kind: e2e_eval
pillar: P07
llm_function: GOVERN
max_bytes: 4096
naming: p07_e2e_{{pipeline}}.md + .yaml
core: false
```

## What It Is
A test that exercises a complete pipeline end-to-end—from raw user input through all agents, tools, and transforms to the final output—and asserts correctness of the result. Tests integration between all stages, not individual components. NOT unit_eval (isolated scope, one agent or prompt). NOT benchmark (measures performance magnitude, not correctness).

## Cross-Framework Map
| Framework/Provider | Class/Concept | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| LangChain | End-to-end chain test | Full chain.invoke() + output assertion |
| LlamaIndex | QueryPipeline eval run | Runs full pipeline, checks final answer |
| CrewAI | Crew.kickoff() test | Full crew run with expected output check |
| DSPy | Evaluate on full program | Runs full compiled program, checks metric |
| Haystack | Pipeline.run() test | Full pipeline execution + output assertions |
| OpenAI | Assistants thread eval | Full thread from user -> final message check |
| Anthropic | Multi-turn eval | Full conversation eval with tool use |

## Key Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| stages | list[str] | required | More stages = more coverage, slower |
| timeout_s | int | 120 | Low = fast fail, high = catches slow paths |
| flakiness_retries | int | 2 | Higher = masks real issues |

## Patterns
| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Happy path | Test nominal flow end-to-end | p07_e2e_research_pipeline.yaml |
| Error recovery | Test failure + fallback handling | p07_e2e_tool_failure_recovery.yaml |
| Multi-agent handoff | Test agent A -> B -> C chain | p07_e2e_research_to_anuncio.yaml |

## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Testing isolated component as e2e | Mislabeled unit_eval | If < full pipeline, use unit_eval |
| No stage list documented | Can't debug failure | List every pipeline stage explicitly |
| Retries > 3 | Masks flaky integration issues | Fix root cause, keep retries <= 2 |

## Integration Graph
```
[eval_dataset] --> [e2e_eval] --> [pass/fail report]
[golden_test] ---> [e2e_eval]         |
                       |----------> [quality_gate (P11)]
                       |----------> [regression_check]
```

## Decision Tree
- IF testing a single agent or prompt in isolation THEN unit_eval
- IF testing the complete pipeline from user input to final output THEN e2e_eval
- IF only running a fast sanity check THEN smoke_eval
- DEFAULT: e2e_eval for integration testing across multi-stage pipelines

## Quality Criteria
- GOOD: Covers happy path, all pipeline stages documented, timeout set
- GREAT: Error paths covered, golden_test cases used as inputs, flakiness tracked
- FAIL: Only tests one stage, no timeout, assertions too vague (e.g., "output exists")
