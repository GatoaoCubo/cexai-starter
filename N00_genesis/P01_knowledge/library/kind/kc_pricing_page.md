# Knowledge Card: pricing_page

## Quick Reference
```yaml
topic: pricing_page
scope: SaaS/infoproduct monetization UI (P05 + P11)
owner: N06_commercial + N02_marketing
criticality: high
builder: pricing-page-builder
```

## Definition
A **pricing_page** is a standalone conversion page presenting subscription tiers
with anchoring, feature matrix, FAQ, and CTA hierarchy for visitor self-selection.

## Key Concepts
- **Anchor tier**: middle tier styled as "Most Popular"; shifts purchases up
- **Feature matrix**: rows=features, cols=tiers; checkmarks show differentiation
- **Annual toggle**: monthly/annual switch with discount badge (e.g. "Save 20%")
- **CTA hierarchy**: primary (highlighted tier) > secondary (other tiers)
- **Trust signals**: logos, testimonials, "no credit card required" badge
- **FAQ section**: minimum 5 objections (cancel anytime, refund, security, upgrade)

## Strategy Phases
1. **Define tiers**: 3 (Free/Pro/Business) or 4 max; map to buyer personas
2. **Set anchor**: middle tier price makes top tier feel reasonable (Weber law)
3. **Build matrix**: cols=tiers, rows=features ordered high->low value
4. **CTA copy**: Free="Get Started Free", Pro="Start Trial", Biz="Contact Sales"
5. **Social proof**: 2-3 logos + 1 testimonial per tier use case
6. **FAQ**: 5 objections (cancel policy, refund, security, upgrade, downgrade)

## Golden Rules
- ANCHOR: highlight 1 tier only (border + badge); highlighting 2+ kills effect
- MATRIX: limit feature rows to 8-10; more = visual noise, not value
- TOGGLE: show annual price by default; monthly toggle reduces conversion 12-18%
- CTA: all primary CTAs above the fold; secondary CTAs repeat at page bottom
- TRUST: "no credit card required" near Free CTA doubles free-tier signup rate

## Flow
```text
[Landing] -> [Toggle annual/monthly] -> [3 tier cards + anchor badge]
[Scroll]  -> [Feature matrix] -> [Social proof] -> [FAQ] -> [Bottom CTA]
```

## Comparativo
| Element | Free | Pro (anchor) | Business |
|---------|------|--------------|----------|
| CTA | "Get Started Free" | "Start Free Trial" | "Contact Sales" |
| Badge | -- | "Most Popular" | -- |
| Price | $0/mo | $X/mo annual | Custom |
| Features shown | 3-4 | 7-8 | All + custom |
| Trust | "No CC needed" | Testimonial | Logo wall |

## Anti-Patterns
- **4+ highlighted tiers**: anchoring fails; visitor paralysis, page exits up
- **Features listed as bullet prose**: matrix table converts 2x better
- **Monthly price default**: annual default + toggle increases LTV conversion
- **Missing FAQ**: 28% of SaaS visitors cite "unclear cancellation" as drop reason
- **Enterprise "call us" without form**: removes low-friction entry for SMB

## Integration Points
| Artifact | Role |

| `landing_page` (P05) | Pricing section or standalone embed |
| `content_monetization` (P11) | Sets tier prices and feature limits |
| `competitive_matrix` (P01) | Informs tier positioning vs. competitors |
| `brand_config.yaml` (P09) | Design tokens: colors, fonts, CTA styles |
