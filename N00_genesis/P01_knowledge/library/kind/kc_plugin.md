# Plugin

## Spec
```yaml
kind: plugin
pillar: P04
llm_function: CALL
max_bytes: 2048
naming: p04_plug_{{name}}.md + .yaml
core: false
```

## What It Is
A plugin is a self-contained, versioned, independently loadable extension that adds capabilities to the agent system through a declared interface. It is registered at startup, discoverable via a manifest, and invocable at runtime. It is NOT a hook (which fires reactively on a specific event, not on-demand), NOT a skill (which is a multi-phase procedural recipe without the plugin lifecycle of discovery, registration, and versioning).

## Cross-Framework Map
| Framework/Provider | Class/Concept | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| LangChain | Custom tool via @tool or BaseTool | Tools are plugins; no separate concept |
| LlamaIndex | QueryEngineTool, FunctionTool | Plugin-like; registered on agent at init |
| CrewAI | Tool class with __call__ | Self-contained tool = plugin pattern |
| DSPy | Module as composable component | DSPy modules compose like plugins |
| Haystack | ComponentBase (custom component) | Pipeline components as registered plugins |
| OpenAI | ChatGPT Plugins (deprecated) | Replaced by Assistants tools API |
| Anthropic | MCP tool server | Closest equivalent; protocol-level plugin |

## Key Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| interface_version | str | required | Must match host version; breaking change guard |
| lazy_load | bool | false | True = load on first call; saves startup RAM |
| isolated | bool | false | True = subprocess isolation for untrusted code |
| depends_on | list | [] | Dependency resolution at registration |

## Patterns
| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Lazy load | Optional rarely-used capability | Load browser_tool plugin only when needed |
| Versioned interface | Multi-version plugin host | plugin_api_version: "2.0" in manifest |
| Sandboxed execution | Untrusted third-party plugin | subprocess + timeout + resource limits |

## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No interface version in manifest | Breaking changes silently crash host | Declare interface_version; validate at load |
| Global mutable state in plugin | Interferes across parallel calls | Pass context via arguments; no class-level state |
| Synchronous blocking call | Stalls host event loop | Async interface required for all plugins |

## Integration Graph
```
[plugin_registry] --> [discover + load] --> [plugin] --> [capability_output]
       |                                       |
[manifest, version]              [interface_version, isolated, lazy_load]
```

## Decision Tree
- IF capability is event-triggered THEN use hook
- IF capability is multi-phase structured recipe THEN use skill
- IF capability needs full protocol server THEN use mcp_server
- DEFAULT: plugin for any discoverable, independently versioned runtime extension

## Quality Criteria
- GOOD: interface_version declared, loads without side effects, returns typed output
- GREAT: lazy load, isolated execution, versioned manifest, dependency graph resolved
- FAIL: no interface contract, global mutable state, no version declaration in manifest
