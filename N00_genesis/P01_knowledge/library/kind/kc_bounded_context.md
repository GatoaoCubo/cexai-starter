# Bounded Context

## Spec
```yaml
kind: bounded_context
pillar: P08
llm_function: CONSTRAIN
max_bytes: 4096
naming: bc_{context_name}.md
```

## What It Is
A bounded_context is an explicit boundary within which a domain model applies, enforcing its own vocabulary and business rules. Evans DDD 2003 ch.14: "A model only works in the context where it is developed and used. [...] Explicitly define the context within which a model applies."

The key insight: the same word can mean different things in different bounded contexts. "Account" in a Banking BC means a financial ledger entry. "Account" in a Social Media BC means a user profile. "Account" in a Sales BC means a customer relationship. These are NOT the same model -- forcing a shared model creates complexity and coupling. Bounded contexts make the ambiguity explicit and manageable.

## What It Is NOT
| Concept | Why Not bounded_context |
|---------|------------------------|
| Microservice | A BC may span multiple services; a service may implement parts of multiple BCs |
| Namespace | Code organization boundary != semantic model boundary |
| component_map | Deployment topology != domain model boundary |
| Module | Technical organization != business concept boundary |
| Team | A team owns a BC, but BC is defined by model, not by org chart |

## Integration Patterns (Context Map)
| Pattern | Abbrev | Meaning | When to Use |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Anti-Corruption Layer | ACL | Translate upstream model to your BC's model | When upstream model would corrupt your clean model |
| Open Host Service | OHS | Publish a public API for consumers to use | When many consumers need your BC's data |
| Conformist | CF | Adopt upstream model as-is | When upstream is dominant and migration cost is high |
| Partnership | P | Two teams coordinate model changes together | When two BCs are tightly coupled and co-owned |
| Published Language | PL | Formalized shared schema (data_contract) | When OHS needs a versioned, documented schema |
| Big Ball of Mud | BBoM | No explicit boundary | NEVER -- leads to semantic drift and coupling debt |

## CEX Bounded Contexts
| BC | Nucleus | Domain | Key Aggregates |
|----|---------|--------|----------------|
| bc_cex_orchestration | N07 | Mission management | Mission, HandoffRegistry, WaveSchedule |
| bc_intelligence | N01 | Research and analysis | ResearchTask, KnowledgeCard, SourceCitation |
| bc_marketing | N02 | Content production | Campaign, CopyVariant, AudienceSegment |
| bc_engineering | N03 | Build and scaffold | BuildTask, Artifact, QualityGate |
| bc_knowledge | N04 | Knowledge management | KnowledgeCard, RAGIndex, EmbeddingConfig |
| bc_operations | N05 | Code and deployment | Pipeline, TestSuite, DeploymentConfig |
| bc_commercial | N06 | Revenue and pricing | PricingTier, RevenueStream, ContentMonetization |

## Context Map Decision Points
- Upstream context: provides data/events to this BC
- Downstream context: consumes data/events from this BC
- ACL selection: use when upstream model is incompatible or unstable
- OHS selection: use when this BC must serve many consumers without N:1 coupling
- Partnership: use when two teams must change their models in lockstep

## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Single model for enterprise | One term means many things; model becomes compromised | Split into explicit bounded contexts |
| BC = microservice (1:1 mapping) | Couples architecture decisions to domain model | BC is semantic; services are technical |
| No context map | Invisible integration = invisible coupling debt | Draw the map; explicit patterns |
| BC without vocabulary | Semantic drift resumes without enforcement | Every BC needs a domain_vocabulary |
| Ownerless BC | No team = no governance = model erosion | One team owns each BC |

## Decision Tree
- IF explicit semantic boundary needed for a domain model -> bounded_context
- IF modeling deployment topology -> component_map
- IF modeling code organization -> namespace or package (not a CEX kind)
- IF need to govern vocabulary within the BC -> domain_vocabulary (for the same BC)
- IF data crosses BC boundary -> data_contract (Published Language)
- DEFAULT: bounded_context when a team owns a domain model with its own vocabulary

## Quality Criteria
- GOOD: semantic scope_statement, team_owner, >= 1 aggregate, domain_vocabulary reference
- GREAT: integration patterns with rationale + domain events published + business invariants + context map position
- FAIL: technical scope_statement OR missing team_owner OR no aggregates OR conflated with service/namespace
