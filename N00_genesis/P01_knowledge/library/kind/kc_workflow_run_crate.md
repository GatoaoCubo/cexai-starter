# Workflow Run Crate

## Introduction
The Workflow Run Crate is a modular framework for orchestrating complex, multi-step processes. It enables developers to define workflows with reusable components, implement robust error handling, and execute tasks in parallel or sequentially. This crate is designed for scenarios requiring structured automation, such as data processing pipelines, CI/CD workflows, and system integration tasks.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Workflow Structure
A workflow is defined as a collection of **tasks** connected by **transitions**. Each task represents a discrete unit of work, while transitions define the flow between tasks.

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Task     | A single unit of work with inputs, outputs, and execution logic |
| Transition | A directed connection between tasks with conditional logic |
| Workflow | A collection of tasks and transitions forming a process |

### 2. Task Types
Tasks can be categorized into three main types based on their execution characteristics:

| Task Type | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Sequential | Tasks execute in a defined order | Data validation → Data transformation → Data storage |
| Parallel | Tasks execute simultaneously | API call 1 → API call 2 → Merge results |
| Conditional | Task execution depends on runtime conditions | If (input validation succeeds) → Process data |

### 3. Error Handling
The crate provides comprehensive error handling mechanisms:

- **Retry policies**: Define retry counts and backoff strategies
- **Fallback tasks**: Execute alternative workflows on failure
- **Error logging**: Automatic logging of exceptions with stack traces

## Workflow Definition Syntax

```yaml
workflow:
  name: "Data Processing Pipeline"
  version: 1.0
  tasks:
    - id: "validate_data"
      type: sequential
      input: "raw_data"
      output: "validated_data"
      handler: "validate_data_handler"
      retry: 3
      timeout: 30s
      fallback: "fallback_handler"
    
    - id: "transform_data"
      type: parallel
      input: "validated_data"
      output: "processed_data"
      handlers:
        - "transform_handler_1"
        - "transform_handler_2"
      timeout: 60s
    
    - id: "store_data"
      type: sequential
      input: "processed_data"
      output: "stored_data"
      handler: "store_data_handler"
      requires: ["validate_data", "transform_data"]
```

## Execution Model

### 1. Task Execution Flow
The execution engine follows these principles:

1. **Task validation**: Check for required inputs and dependencies
2. **Resource allocation**: Assign execution context and memory
3. **Task execution**: Run the handler function with input data
4. **Result processing**: Handle outputs and update workflow state
5. **Transition evaluation**: Determine next tasks based on execution outcome

### 2. Parallel Execution
For parallel tasks, the engine:

- Creates isolated execution contexts
- Monitors task progress
- Aggregates results from all parallel branches
- Handles failures in individual parallel tasks

## Best Practices

### 1. Task Design
- Keep tasks focused on single responsibilities
- Use clear naming conventions for tasks and outputs
- Implement idempotent operations where possible
- Include validation for input data

### 2. Error Handling
- Define clear retry policies for transient failures
- Implement fallback tasks for critical failures
- Log detailed error information for debugging
- Use circuit breakers for external service calls

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Use parallel execution for independent tasks
- Implement caching for frequently used data
- Optimize task dependencies to minimize redundant work
- Use asynchronous execution for I/O-bound operations

## Example Workflows

### 1. Data Processing Pipeline
```yaml
workflow:
  name: "Customer Data Processing"
  tasks:
    - id: "fetch_data"
      type: sequential
      handler: "fetch_customer_data"
      output: "raw_data"
    
    - id: "validate_data"
      type: sequential
      handler: "validate_customer_data"
      input: "raw_data"
      output: "validated_data"
      fallback: "handle_invalid_data"
    
    - id: "process_data"
      type: parallel
      input: "validated_data"
      handlers:
        - "process_data_branch_1"
        - "process_data_branch_2"
      output: "processed_data"
    
    - id: "store_data"
      type: sequential
      handler: "store_customer_data"
      input: "processed_data"
```

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
workflow:
  name: "CI/CD Pipeline"
  tasks:
    - id: "code_analysis"
      type: sequential
      handler: "run_static_analysis"
      output: "analysis_results"
      timeout: 5m
    
    - id: "unit_tests"
      type: parallel
      handlers:
        - "run_unit_tests"
        - "run_integration_tests"
      output: "test_results"
      timeout: 10m
    
    - id: "build_artifacts"
      type: sequential
      input: "test_results"
      handler: "build_project"
      output: "build_artifacts"
      requires: ["code_analysis", "unit_tests"]
    
    - id: "deploy"
      type: conditional
      input: "build_artifacts"
      handler: "deploy_to_production"
      condition: "test_results.passed"
      fallback: "deploy_to_staging"
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Task Dependencies
Tasks can have complex dependency relationships:

- **Sequential dependencies**: Task B depends on Task A
- **Parallel dependencies**: Task C depends on both Task A and B
- **Conditional dependencies**: Task D depends on Task A's success

```yaml
dependencies:
  task_c:
    requires:
      - task_a
      - task_b
  task_d:
    requires:
      - task_a
    condition:
      - task_a.output.status == "success"
```

### 2. Resource Management
The crate provides resource management capabilities:

- **Memory allocation**: Define memory limits for tasks
- **CPU allocation**: Set CPU constraints for task execution
- **Timeouts**: Define maximum execution time for tasks
- **Priority scheduling**: Assign priority to critical tasks

### 3. Monitoring and Logging
- **Real-time monitoring**: Track task progress and status
- **Detailed logging**: Capture execution metrics and diagnostics
- **Alerting**: Configure alerts for task failures or anomalies
- **Audit trails**: Maintain records of workflow executions

## Common Use Cases

| Use Case | Description | Workflow Pattern |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| Data Pipeline | Process and transform data from source to destination | Sequential with parallel processing |
| CI/CD | Automate testing and deployment | Conditional with parallel execution |
| System Integration | Coordinate multiple services | Parallel with fallback tasks |
| Batch Processing | Process large datasets | Sequential with memory optimization |
| API Gateway | Route requests to appropriate services | Conditional with parallel execution |

## Workflow Lifecycle

The workflow lifecycle consists of these stages:

1. **Design**: Define tasks, dependencies, and execution logic
2. **Validation**: Check for syntax errors and logical consistency
3. **Execution**: Run the workflow with specified parameters
4. **Monitoring**: Track progress and handle failures
5. **Completion**: Finalize results and generate reports

## Security and Compliance

- **Access Control**: Define permissions for task execution
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain logs of all workflow executions
- **Data Protection**: Implement encryption for sensitive data
- **Compliance Checks**: Ensure adherence to regulatory requirements

## Conclusion
The Workflow Run Crate provides a powerful framework for building complex automation workflows. By leveraging its modular architecture, robust error handling, and flexible execution model, developers can create efficient, maintainable, and scalable automation solutions. The crate's support for parallel execution, conditional branching, and comprehensive monitoring makes it suitable for a wide range of automation scenarios, from simple data processing tasks to complex system integration workflows.
