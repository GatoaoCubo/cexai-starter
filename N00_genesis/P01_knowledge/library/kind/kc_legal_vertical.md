# Legal Industry Vertical: Key Concepts

## 1. Privilege

- **Attorney-Client Privilege**: Confidential communications between lawyer and client for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice. Protected under Rule 1.6 of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct.
- **Work Product Protection**: Shielded documents created for litigation preparation (Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)). Divided into "ordinary" (factual) and "opinion" (mental impressions) categories.
- **Exceptions**: Spontaneous disclosures, third-party access, crime-fraud exception, and non-privileged communications.
- **Waiver Risks**: Inadvertent disclosure under FRE 502(b) -- requires reasonable steps to prevent and prompt rectification.

## 2. Billable Hour and Alternative Fee Models

- **Time Tracking**: Detailed logging of attorney work (e.g., 1.5 hours for document review), typically in 6-minute (0.1 hour) increments
- **Billing Practices**: Fixed fees vs hourly rates, time entry validation, pre-bill review
- **Ethical Considerations**: ABA Model Rule 1.5 -- fees must be reasonable; prohibited billable hours for non-legal tasks
- **Alternative Fee Arrangements (AFAs)**: Flat fee, capped fee, success fee, blended rate, subscription retainer

| Fee Model | Description | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Hourly | Time-based billing at agreed rate | Complex litigation, unpredictable scope |
| Flat Fee | Fixed price for defined scope | Routine transactions, document drafting |
| Capped Fee | Hourly with maximum ceiling | Projects with bounded complexity |
| Success Fee | Payment contingent on outcome | Plaintiff litigation, M&A closings |
| Blended Rate | Single rate across team seniority | Portfolio clients, ongoing matters |
| Subscription | Monthly retainer for ongoing access | GC/outside counsel relationships |

## 3. Contract Analysis

- **Key Elements**: Parties, obligations, termination clauses, governing law, force majeure
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying hidden liabilities, enforceability gaps, and indemnification exposure
- **Negotiation Support**: Drafting clauses for dispute resolution, performance metrics, and liability caps
- **AI-Assisted Review**: NLP extraction of key terms, obligation tracking, deviation scoring against playbook

## 4. Compliance Frameworks

Legal technology must operate within regulatory boundaries. The following frameworks define the compliance landscape:

| Framework | Domain | Key Requirements | Jurisdiction |
|-----------|--------|------------------|-------------|
| GDPR | Data privacy | Data minimization, consent, DPO, 72h breach notification | EU/EEA |
| CCPA/CPRA | Consumer privacy | Opt-out rights, data deletion, no discrimination | California, USA |
| SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley) | Financial reporting | Internal controls, audit trails, CEO/CFO certification | USA (public companies) |
| HIPAA | Health data | PHI safeguards, BAAs, breach notification | USA |
| AML/KYC | Financial crime | Customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, SAR filing | Global |
| eDiscovery (FRCP) | Litigation | Preservation holds, proportionality, TAR validation | USA federal courts |
| ITAR/EAR | Export control | Technology transfer restrictions, license requirements | USA |

## 6. eDiscovery and Technology-Assisted Review (TAR)

The EDRM (Electronic Discovery Reference Model) defines the standard workflow:

```
Information     -->  Identification  -->  Preservation  -->  Collection
Governance              |                     |                |
                        v                     v                v
                   Processing  -->  Review  -->  Analysis  -->  Production
                        |              |            |              |
                        v              v            v              v
                   De-duplication   TAR/CAL    Clustering    Bates numbering
                   + filtering     (ML-based)  + threading   + redaction
```

- **TAR 1.0 (Simple Passive Learning)**: SME reviews seed set, model classifies remainder
- **TAR 2.0 (Continuous Active Learning / CAL)**: Model continuously learns from each reviewer decision, prioritizes most informative documents
- **Validation**: Recall targets typically 70-80% for reasonable review; elusion testing on discard pile

## 7. Use Cases for AI in Legal

- **Document Review**: Privilege log creation, redaction, and TAR-based relevance classification
- **Compliance Audits**: Regulatory document analysis, risk mapping, and gap identification
- **Transaction Support**: Due diligence reviews, contract negotiation, and data room analysis
- **Litigation Support**: Discovery document analysis, evidentiary review, and case timeline construction
- **Legal Research**: Case law search, statutory analysis, and precedent identification via NLP
- **Contract Intelligence**: Clause extraction, obligation tracking, and deviation scoring against standard playbooks
