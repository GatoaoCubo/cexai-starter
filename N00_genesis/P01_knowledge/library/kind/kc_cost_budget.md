# Cost Budget

## Spec
```yaml
kind: cost_budget
pillar: P09
llm_function: CONSTRAIN
max_bytes: 4096
naming: p09_cb_{{name}}.yaml
core: false
```

## What It Is
A cost_budget defines token budget allocation, USD spend tracking, cost alerts per provider/model/nucleus, and rollover policies -- enabling financial governance of LLM operations. It is NOT a rate_limit_config (which governs requests-per-second throughput, not monetary cost), NOT a context_window_config (which sizes the prompt, not the spend), NOT a token counting utility (which measures usage, not budgets).

## Cross-Framework Map
| Framework/Provider | Class/Concept | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| LiteLLM | `max_budget`, `BudgetManager` | Per-user/team budgets with spend tracking |
| Helicone | Cost dashboard + alerts | Real-time cost monitoring, per-request cost attribution |
| LangSmith | Cost tracking in traces | Per-run cost aggregation from trace metadata |
| OpenAI | Usage API + billing limits | Monthly hard cap, per-organization spend alerts |
| Anthropic | Usage API + rate tiers | Credit-based billing, tier-specific token limits |
| Portkey | `Budget` + `CostLimiter` | Per-virtual-key budgets with automatic cutoff |
| BerriAI/LiteLLM Proxy | `budgets` config | Team-level token/USD budgets with routing |
| Weights & Biases | W&B Launch cost tracking | Per-sweep/per-run cost attribution |

## Key Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Tradeoff |
|-----------|------|---------|----------|
| budget_period | enum | monthly | daily/weekly/monthly -- shorter = tighter control, more admin overhead |
| max_tokens | int | null | Hard token ceiling per period -- null = uncapped (risky) |
| max_cost_usd | float | required | USD hard cap -- the ultimate guardrail |
| provider_rates | map | required | Per-model input/output token prices -- stale rates = wrong projections |
| alert_thresholds | list[float] | [0.5, 0.8, 0.95] | Percentage triggers for warnings -- too many = alert fatigue |
| rollover | bool | false | Unused budget carries forward -- true = flexible but less predictable |
| scope | enum | global | global/per_nucleus/per_mission -- granularity vs. management complexity |
| fallback_on_exhaust | enum | block | block/downgrade/alert_only -- block is safest, downgrade preserves availability |

## Patterns
| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Per-nucleus budget | Isolate spend by function | `n01: {max_cost_usd: 5.00}`, `n03: {max_cost_usd: 10.00}` |
| Per-mission budget | Cap total mission spend | `mission_X: {max_cost_usd: 50.00, max_tokens: 2_000_000}` |
| Tiered model routing | Route to cheaper model when budget low | `if remaining < 20%: route opus -> sonnet -> haiku` |
| Prompt caching savings | Track cache hit rate as cost reduction | `cache_savings: {enabled: true, target_hit_rate: 0.6}` |
| Batch API discount | Use batch endpoints for non-urgent work | `batch_eligible: true, discount_pct: 50, max_latency: 24h` |

## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| No max_cost_usd | Runaway agents generate unbounded spend overnight | Always set a hard USD cap, even generous ones |
| Stale provider_rates | Cost projections diverge from actual bills | Update rates monthly or use provider API for live pricing |
| Global-only budget | One nucleus exhausts budget, starves all others | Use per_nucleus scope with individual caps |
| Alert-only on exhaust | Alerts get ignored at 3 AM; spend continues | Use block or downgrade as fallback_on_exhaust |
| No input/output split | Output tokens cost 3-5x input -- flat rate underestimates | Always separate input_price and output_price per model |

## Integration Graph
```
rate_limit_config, env_config --> [cost_budget] --> runtime_rule, agent_card
                                       |
                                  model_provider, experiment_config, feature_flag
```

## Decision Tree
- IF governing USD spend and token allocation THEN cost_budget
- IF governing requests-per-second throughput THEN rate_limit_config
- IF sizing the context window THEN context_window_config
- IF simple on/off cost toggle THEN feature_flag
- DEFAULT: cost_budget when financial governance of LLM operations is needed

## Quality Criteria
- GOOD: max_cost_usd, provider_rates, alert_thresholds all present
- GREAT: per-nucleus scope, input/output price split, fallback_on_exhaust=block, batch discount tracked
- FAIL: no max_cost_usd, stale provider_rates, global-only with multi-nucleus system
