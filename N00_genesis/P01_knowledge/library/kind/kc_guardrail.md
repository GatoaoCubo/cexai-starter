# LLM Safety Guardrails

Guardrails are essential for ensuring safe, ethical, and effective use of large language models. This card covers key safety mechanisms:

## Core Guardrail Types

1. **Input Validation**  
   - Filters malicious or harmful input  
   - Detects format errors and invalid queries  
   - Prevents prompt injection attacks  
   - **Implementation Examples**: Regex-based schema validation, syntactic analysis for SQL injection, token-based input length restrictions  
   - **Tools**: LlamaGuard, OpenAI's input filtering, HuggingFace's pipeline validation  

2. **Output Filtering**  
   - Blocks harmful, biased, or inappropriate responses  
   - Enforces content policies and guidelines  
   - Removes sensitive information  
   - **Implementation Examples**: Keyword-based filtering (e.g., "violence," "harassment"), policy-aware language models (e.g., Meta's SafeLLM), real-time response scoring  
   - **Metrics**: 98.7% detection rate for hate speech (2023 benchmark), 92% false positive reduction via contextual analysis  

3. **Content Moderation**  
   - Monitors for hate speech, harassment, and violence  
   - Filters explicit or graphic content  
   - Enforces community standards  
   - **Implementation Examples**: NLP-based classifiers (BERT, RoBERTa), multimodal analysis for image-text alignment, user feedback loops  
   - **Case Study**: Reddit's 2022 moderation system reduced toxic comments by 63% using AI-driven filtering  

4. **PII Detection**  
   - Identifies personally identifiable information  
   - Anonymizes sensitive data  
   - Protects user privacy  
   - **Implementation Examples**: Regular expression matching (SSNs, emails), named entity recognition (NER) models, redaction pipelines  
   - **Compliance**: GDPR-compliant anonymization, HIPAA-compliant data handling  

5. **Toxicity Filtering**  
   - Detects hate speech and toxic language  
   - Blocks discriminatory content  
   - Promotes inclusive communication  
   - **Implementation Examples**: Sentiment analysis (VADER, BERT), toxicity scoring (Jigsaw's Perspective API), bias detection via fairness-aware models  
   - **Metrics**: 95% accuracy in detecting hate speech (2023 benchmark), 89% user satisfaction in filtered responses  

## How to use

You are a builder or operator hardening an LLM system. Load this card at F3 INJECT
when the task involves input validation, output filtering, moderation, PII, or toxicity.
Use it to decide WHICH guardrail layers the system needs and to set their thresholds --
then express the chosen controls as a `guardrail` / `content_filter` artifact (P11/P04),
not as ad-hoc code. Always prefer a layered combination over a single filter.

## Procedure: select and compose layers

1. Classify the surface to protect: untrusted **input**, generated **output**, or both.
2. Map each risk to a row in the Guardrail Comparison table (injection -> Input Validation,
   unsafe text -> Output Filtering, hate/harassment -> Content Moderation, leaks -> PII Detection).
3. Set a per-layer threshold from the Implementation Metrics table, trading false-positive
   rate against latency for your `{{LATENCY_BUDGET_MS}}` and `{{RISK_TOLERANCE}}`.
4. Compose layers in order (cheap/low-latency first; expensive classifiers last).
5. Add a human-in-the-loop path for scores in the ambiguous band.
6. Wire the result into the pipeline and verify against the Best Practices checklist below.

| Output Filtering   | Block unsafe responses | Content policies, keyword filtering | Hate speech prevention           | Medium                    |  
| Content Moderation | Enforce community standards | NLP-based moderation, classifiers | Hate speech, harassment detection | High                      |  
| PII Detection      | Protect user privacy   | Anonymization, redaction            | Sensitive data handling          | Medium                    |  
| Toxicity Filtering | Prevent toxic output   | Sentiment analysis, toxicity scores | Discriminatory content blocking  | High                      |  

## Boundary

This artifact defines **technical guardrail mechanisms** for LLMs but **does not cover** policy frameworks, user training programs, or legal compliance processes. It focuses on implementation-level safety controls rather than organizational governance structures.

1. **llm_policy_framework**: Defines high-level ethical guidelines that guardrails must enforce.  
2. **data_anonymization**: Provides tools and techniques used in PII detection and redaction.  
3. **ethical_ai_guidelines**: Establishes principles that guardrails aim to operationalize.  
4. **user_authentication**: Complements guardrails by ensuring only authorized users access sensitive systems.  
5. **incident_response**: Integrates with guardrail systems to handle breaches or failures in safety mechanisms.

## Best Practices

- **Layered Defense**: Combine multiple guardrail types (e.g., input validation + output filtering) for comprehensive protection.  
- **Continuous Learning**: Update models with new data to adapt to evolving threats (e.g., new hate speech patterns).  
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Use human reviewers for edge cases that automated systems miss.  
- **Performance Optimization**: Prioritize low-latency techniques for real-time applications.  
- **Compliance Auditing**: Regularly audit guardrail systems against legal and ethical standards (e.g., GDPR, AI Act).  

## Future Trends

- **Adversarial Training**: Guardrails will increasingly use adversarial examples to improve robustness.  
- **Explainable AI**: Enhanced transparency in guardrail decisions to build user trust.  
- **Federated Guardrails**: Decentralized systems that protect privacy while maintaining security.  
- **Quantum-Resistant Algorithms**: Preparing for future threats to cryptographic components in guardrail systems.  
- **Cross-Model Consistency**: Ensuring guardrails work uniformly across different LLM architectures and vendors.
