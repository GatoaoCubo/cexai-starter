## Explanation

N07's core skill is transmutation: convert vague user tokens into the canonical
`{kind, pillar, nucleus, verb}` tuple, then write a concrete handoff.
These 5 pairs calibrate easy (single kind) through hard (grid + wave plan).
Each output shows the exact structured form N07 must produce -- not prose, not
summary, but machine-readable dispatch that any nucleus can execute without
further clarification.

## How to use

You are N07 (or the prompt compiler) resolving a fresh user wish. Use these pairs as
the pattern to imitate:

1. Read the user input; match it to the closest of the 5 example shapes.
2. Emit the `Resolved Intent` block first -- including a `confidence` score.
3. If confidence < 0.80, STOP and present top-3 interpretations via GDP (see Edge Cases).
4. Otherwise emit the `Handoff Snippet` verbatim-in-form, binding the `{{slug}}`/`{path}` slots.
5. Never skip the snippet -- a resolved tuple without a handoff is not yet dispatchable.

The arc is deliberate: Examples 1-2 are single-kind builds, 3 is tool-only (`kind: null`),
4-5 are orchestrator self-dispatch (grid + sweep) that gate on GDP.

## Example 1 (easy) -- Single artifact, clear kind

**Input**
```
"make me a landing page"
```

**Resolved Intent**
```yaml
kind: landing_page
pillar: P05
nucleus: N03
verb: create
confidence: 0.92
```

**Handoff Snippet**
```markdown
## Task
Produce kind=landing_page, pillar=P05, using landing-page-builder ISOs.
Builder: archetypes/builders/landing-page-builder/
Output: N03_engineering/P05_output/landing_page_{{slug}}.md
Compile after save: python _tools/cex_compile.py {path}
Signal: write_signal("n03", "complete", null)
```

---

## Example 2 (easy) -- Research domain, nucleus routing

**Input**
```
"research competitors"
```

**Resolved Intent**
```yaml
kind: knowledge_card
pillar: P01
nucleus: N01
verb: analyze
domain: competitive-intelligence
confidence: 0.88
```

**Handoff Snippet**
```markdown
## Task
Produce kind=knowledge_card, pillar=P01, domain=competitive-intelligence.
Builder: archetypes/builders/knowledge-card-builder/
Scan: N01_intelligence/P01_knowledge/ for existing competitor KCs first.
Output: N01_intelligence/P01_knowledge/kc_competitor_{{slug}}.md
Signal: write_signal("n01", "complete", null)
```

---

## Example 3 (medium) -- Tool invocation, no kind

**Input**
```
"fix the tests"
```

**Resolved Intent**
```yaml
kind: null
pillar: P07
nucleus: N05
verb: validate
tool: cex_e2e_test.py
action: debug_and_repair
confidence: 0.85
```

**Handoff Snippet**
```markdown
## Task
No artifact to produce. Run: python _tools/cex_e2e_test.py --verbose  <!-- [NOT SHIPPED in this tenant -- Central-only tool] -->
For each FAIL: diagnose root cause, apply fix, rerun until PASS.
Commit fixes: git commit -m "[N05] fix failing e2e tests"
Signal: write_signal("n05", "complete", null)
```

---

## Example 4 (hard) -- Grid dispatch, wave plan

**Input**
```
"launch all nuclei"
```

**Resolved Intent**
```yaml
kind: null
pillar: P12
nucleus: N07
verb: dispatch
mode: grid
wave_count: 1
targets: [n01, n02, n03, n04, n05, n06]
confidence: 0.79
gdp_required: true
```

**Handoff Snippet**
```markdown
## GDP Decision Required
Q1: What is the mission goal? (grid needs a task per nucleus)
Q2: Parallel or sequential waves?
-- After GDP --
Write 6 handoff files: .cex/runtime/handoffs/MISSION_{nucleus}.md
Run: the Task tool (in-session) grid MISSION
Monitor: git log --oneline --since="5 minutes ago"
Consolidate after all 6 signal complete.
```

---

## Example 5 (hard) -- Sweep tool, quality threshold

**Input**
```
"improve bad artifacts"
```

**Resolved Intent**
```yaml
kind: null
pillar: P11
nucleus: N07
verb: improve
tool: cex_evolve.py
threshold: 9.0
mode: heuristic_then_agent
confidence: 0.91
```

**Handoff Snippet**
```markdown
## Task
Run: python _tools/cex_evolve.py --sweep --threshold 9.0 --mode heuristic  <!-- [NOT SHIPPED in this tenant -- Central-only tool] -->
Then: python _tools/cex_evolve.py --sweep --threshold 9.0 --mode agent --budget 50  <!-- [NOT SHIPPED in this tenant -- Central-only tool] -->
Artifacts below quality 9.0 are retried up to 2 passes.
Commit: git commit -m "[N07] evolve: heuristic+agent sweep, threshold=9.0"
Signal: write_signal("n07", "complete", null)
```

## Edge Cases

- **Grid without goal**: input "launch all nuclei" triggers GDP (Example 4) --
  N07 must NOT dispatch without knowing the per-nucleus task.
- **Tool-only dispatch** (no kind): "fix tests" routes to N05 + tool, not a builder.
  `kind: null` is valid when the action is operational, not artifact-producing.
- **Confidence < 0.80**: present top-3 interpretations to user via GDP before
  dispatching. Do not guess silently.

## Variations

- "write a system prompt for N03" -> kind=system_prompt, pillar=P03, nucleus=N03, verb=create
- "schedule the overnight loop" -> kind=schedule, pillar=P12, nucleus=N07, tool=overnight.ps1
- "what agents do we have?" -> kind=null, verb=query, tool=cex_capability_index.py
