## Overview

N07 Orchestrator retrieves operational context across five document collections:
handoff history, signal archive, mission plans, decision manifests, and the
257-kind taxonomy. Retrieval drives dispatch decisions -- every millisecond
of latency compounds across the full pipeline. The Orchestrating Sloth sin
lens enforces precision over recall: never fetch more than the dispatcher
needs, always enforce a score floor, cache the taxonomy cold-start.

Collections and their query profiles:

| Collection | Query type | top_k | Primary signal |
|------------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Handoffs | nucleus name + mission ID (keyword) | 5 | BM25 exact match |
| Signals | nucleus + timestamp range (filter + keyword) | 10 | Filter then BM25 |
| Knowledge cards (KCs) | semantic intent (vector) | 3 | Dense similarity |
| Decision manifests | keyword: GDP field names | 3 | BM25 exact match |
| 257-kind taxonomy | kind/pillar lookup (cache-first) | 1 | Cache hit, else BM25 |

## Search Strategy

Algorithm: hybrid reciprocal rank fusion (RRF), k=60.
Sparse leg: BM25 over raw text -- preferred for exact kind/nucleus/mission names.
Dense leg: vector cosine on nomic-embed-text -- preferred for semantic intent matching.
Fusion weights: sparse=0.6, dense=0.4 (keyword precision dominates in orchestration).

Reranker: cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 applied to top-20 RRF candidates,
outputs final top_k per doc_type. Reranker is skipped for taxonomy lookups
(cache-first, exact match, no semantic ambiguity).

Cache layer: LRU cache, TTL=300s.
- Cached: 257-kind taxonomy (full load at session start), last-5 handoffs per nucleus.
- Evicted: signals older than TTL, stale mission plans after consolidation.

Score floor: 0.35 minimum similarity after rerank. Results below floor are dropped
rather than injected as weak context -- weak context causes wrong dispatch.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| store_type | BM25 + FAISS vector | BM25 for exact ops names; FAISS for semantic fallback |
| search_type | hybrid | Orchestration mixes exact (nucleus/kind) and semantic (intent) queries |
| hybrid_ratio | 0.4 dense / 0.6 sparse | Keyword precision dominates in dispatch context |
| top_k (handoffs) | 5 | 5 most recent/relevant handoffs = sufficient dispatch context |
| top_k (signals) | 10 | Signal fan-out from 6 nuclei; need full wave visibility |
| top_k (KCs) | 3 | Token budget: 3 KCs per dispatch round is the context cap |
| top_k (decisions) | 3 | GDP manifests are compact; 3 covers most mission scopes |
| top_k (taxonomy) | 1 (cache) | Kind/pillar lookups are exact; cache eliminates retrieval entirely |
| fetch_k | 20 | 4x max top_k (signals=10); feeds reranker with sufficient candidates |
| reranker | cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 | <50ms cross-encoder; accurate enough, fast enough for dispatcher |
| score_threshold | 0.35 | Drops irrelevant docs; wrong-nucleus context causes bad dispatch |
| cache_ttl | 300s | Handoff updates are infrequent within a wave; 5 min is safe |

## Filters

Applied before retrieval to reduce candidate space:

| Filter | Type | Applied to |
|--------|------|------------|
| nucleus | enum (n01..n07) | Handoffs, signals, KCs |
| mission | string match | Handoffs, decision manifests |
| date_range | ISO 8601 window | Signals (last wave only by default) |
| kind | enum (300 kinds) | KCs, taxonomy lookups |
| status | enum (pending, complete, failed) | Signals |

Filter precedence: nucleus > mission > date_range > kind > status.
Filters are pre-retrieval (applied to index, not post-rerank).

## Integration

- Input: query string + optional filter dict `{nucleus, mission, date_range, kind}`
- Output: list of `(Document, score)` tuples, ranked by cross-encoder score
- Upstream: `cex_retriever.py` (TF-IDF + vector backend), `.cex/runtime/handoffs/`, `.cex/runtime/signals/`
- Downstream: N07 F3 INJECT context assembly, handoff writer, wave planner
- Cache backend: in-process LRU (`cex_memory_select.py` keyword layer)
- Taxonomy source: `.cex/kinds_meta.json` (loaded once at session start, never re-fetched)
- Fallback: if score_threshold produces zero results, relax to 0.20 and re-query once; if still empty, return empty and log miss
